## 🏃 Run project

Based on the setup and usage steps described above, assuming the local and cloud infrastructure works and the `.env` is filled as expected, follow the next steps to run the LLM system end-to-end:

### Data

1. Collect data: `poetry poe run-digital-data-etl`

2. Compute features: `poetry poe run-feature-engineering-pipeline`

3. Compute instruct dataset: `poetry poe run-generate-instruct-datasets-pipeline`

4. Compute preference alignment dataset: `poetry poe run-generate-preference-datasets-pipeline`

### Training

5. SFT fine-tuning Llamma 3.1: `poetry poe run-training-pipeline`

6. For DPO, go to `configs/training.yaml`, change `finetuning_type` to `dpo`, and run `poetry poe run-training-pipeline` again

7. Evaluate fine-tuned models: `poetry poe run-evaluation-pipeline`

### Inference

8. Call only the RAG retrieval module: `poetry poe call-rag-retrieval-module`

9. Deploy the LLM Twin microservice to SageMaker: `poetry poe deploy-inference-endpoint`

10. Test the LLM Twin microservice: `poetry poe test-sagemaker-endpoint`

11. Start end-to-end RAG server: `poetry poe run-inference-ml-service`

12. Test RAG server: `poetry poe call-inference-ml-service`
