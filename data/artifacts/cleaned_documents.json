            "content": "lecture2_FRW Phys 236 Cosmology Lecture 2 The Robertson Walker Metric The \ufb01rst key observation in modern cosmology was the discovery of the expanding universe by Edwin Hubbble. By 1929 he had obtained Cepheid distances for 24 galaxies with red shifts and claimed that these displayed a linear relationship v Hd. He cited theoretical predictions from relativistic cosmology that redshift or velocity should increase linearly with distance in an expanding Universe as a possible explanation. At the time, Hubble estimated H 500 km s 1 Mpc 1, because his calibration of Cepheid luminosities was in error. The best modern value is close to 70 km s 1 Mpc 1. In this and the following few lectures we will work out the mathematical description of expanding spacetime that leads to Hubbble s law. 1 Hubble Expansion and Scale Factor a t Figure 1 Expansion of the Universe. The comoving distance between points on an imag inary coordinate grid remains constant as the universe expands. The physical distance is proportional to the comoving distance times the scale factor a t and hence increases with time. Figure from Baumann. Now we begin to mathematically codify the idea of an expanding Universe. Consider a distribution of galaxies that is made to expand uniformly, in the same way as if a picture of the pattern was undergoing continuous magni\ufb01cation as illustrated in Fig. 1. Mathematically, this means that all position vectors at time t are just scaled versions of their values at a reference time t0 x t a t x t0 . 1 Di\ufb00erentiating this with respect to t gives x t a t x t0 a t a t x t , 2 or a velocity proportional to distance, as required. Writing this relation for two points 1 and 2 and subtracting, shows that this expansion appears the same for any choice of origin 1 everyone is the center of the universe x2 t x1 t H t x2 t x1 t H t a a. 3 This shows that the Hubble constant can be identi\ufb01ed with a a, and that in general it is not a constant, but something that can change with time. 2 The Robsertson Walker Metric 2.1 Assumptions The standard model in cosmology is the nearly homogeneous and isotropic expansion of the Universe, according to the theory of General Relativity, that ultimately traces back to a hot Big Bang. To describe the Universe as a whole we make no attempts to incorporate discrete structures like galaxies or clusters. We imagine all matter in the Universe smeared out into an idealized, smooth \ufb02uid that de\ufb01nes the overall kinematics of the system of galaxies. The mathematical framework for the standard model is based on theCosmological Princi ple, which is the hypothesis that, on su\ufb03ciently large scales1 the Universe can be considered spatially homogeneous and isotropic. Philosophically this can be thought of as a generaliza tion of the Copernican Principle , that there is nothing special or priveleged about our place in the universe. The cosmological principle can also be stated as the existence of a fundamental observer at each location, to whom the Universe appears isotropic. The concept of a fundamental observer is required because two observers at the same point, but in relative motion, cannot both see the surrounding Universe as isotropic. The fundamental observer thus implies a cosmological rest frame at each location in space and this rest frame is de\ufb01ned to be one that is comoving with the Universe s global expansion, or being in the Hubble \ufb02ow . More speci\ufb01cally, imagine the expanding universe \ufb01lled with fundamental observers each at di\ufb00erent locations, all of whom are at rest with respect to the matter in their vicinity. We can envisage them as each sitting on a di\ufb00erent galaxy, and so receding from each other with the general Hubble expansion. Actually this is not quite right, since each galaxy has a peculiar velocity with respect to its neighbors of a few hundred km s 1 which are sourced by density \ufb02uctuations. We really need to imagine an idealized universe where the matter density is uniform. The fundamental observers give us a way of de\ufb01ning a universal time coordinate, even though relativity tells us that such a thing is impossible in general. We can de\ufb01ne a cosmological time t, which is the time measured by the clocks of these observers i.e. t is the proper time measured by an observer at rest with respect to the local matter distribution and hence comoving with the expansion of the Universe. A nice concrete example of this idea of a fundamental observer at work occurs in analysis of the CMB. The most prominent CMB anisotropy is actually a yin yang dipole pattern of redshifted and blueshifted photons that is induced by the motion of the solar system in the Milky Way and the peculiar velocity of the Milky Way and local group of galaxies relative 1Practically speaking this length scale is around 100 Mpc 2 to a fundamental observer comoving with the Hubble \ufb02ow. 2.2 The Robertson Walker Metric In GR, the presence of massive bodies simply a\ufb00ects the geometry of four dimensional spacetime. At every point in spacetime there is a metric a geometry that is determined by the gravitational \ufb01eld at that point. Given a geometry, we can calculate the equations of motion. It was shown in 1935 by Robertson Walker that the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy requires the metric to take the form, in spherical polar coordinates, ds2 c2dt2 a2 t dr2 S2 k r d\u03b82 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 c2dt2 a2 t dr2 S2 k r d\u21262 , 4 where Sk r R0 sin r R0 k 1 r k 0 R0 sinh r R0 k 1 5 This is known as the Robertson Walker RW metric or the Friedmann Robertson Walker metric . Here a t is the scale factor introduced in 1 which determines the overall scale of the spatial part of the metric and thus describes how distances expand or contract with time. The quantity k 1, 0, or 1 is the curvature constant, and d\u21262 d\u03b82 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 is the familiar solid angle from spherical coordinates, and r is a time independent comoving radial coordinate comoving observers have the same r at all times, even if the Universe expands or contracts. The quantity R0 is the radius of curvature of the universe at the present epoch. The quantity ds2 is an invariant interval between two neighboring events in spacetime sep arated by dx\u00b5, \u00b5 0 ,1,2,3 . In the language of GR this interval ds2 can be written as ds2 \u00b5\u03bd g\u00b5\u03bddx\u00b5dx\u03bd, 6 where g\u00b5\u03bd is the metric tensor a symmetric N N matrix, where N 4 is the dimension of the spacetime , which expresses the notion of distance between spacetime points. The metric determines the trajectories of free falling bodies they move along geodesics of the spacetime and also how light propagates in curved space light travels along so called null geodesics with ds2 0. The indices \u00b5 and \u03bd run over the time coordinate labelled 0 and the 3 space coordinates. In general, g\u00b5\u03bd will be a complicated function of space and time with o\ufb00 diagonal terms that make the separation of space and time impossible. However, the metric tensor simpli\ufb01es enormously when space is homogeneous and isotropic. Finally, note that the coordinate system used above is not the only possibility. For example if we peform a change of varaibles \u03c1 Sk r , the metric for a homogenous, isotropic, three dimensional space can be written ds2 c2dt2 a2 t d\u03c12 1 k \u03c1 R0 2 \u03c12d\u21262 . 7 3 which has the advantage that the \u03c12d\u21262 terms looks like what one gets in spherical coordi nates for Euclidean i.e. \ufb02at space. 2.3 Building Intuition For Metrics Whether we use the term or not, we are all familiar with metrics. For example, using the Pythagorean theorem we can write the distance between two points in ordinary 3D space as s2 x2 y2 z2, 8 which de\ufb01nes the so called Euclidean metric. In the special theory of relativity this becomes generalized to the distance between two spacetime points s2 ct 2 x2 y2 z2. 9 We can write the in\ufb01nitesimal version of this as ds2 \u00b5\u03bd \u03b7\u00b5\u03bddx\u00b5dx\u03bd, 10 where the only nonzero components of the metric tensor are the diagonal terms 1,1,1,1 Minkowski spacetime , and where it is understood that dx0 cdt. If the two events are connected by a signal travelling at v, such that dxi vidt then ds2 c2dt2 1 v2 c2 . 11 A light pulse expands in a sphere at the speed of light, so v c and thus it travels along a null geodesic with ds2 0, such that the events can be connected by a light ray. In spherical coordinates x rsin \u03b8cos \u03c6 y rsin \u03b8sin \u03c6 z rcos \u03b8, 12 where r is the radial coordinate, \u03b8 is the polar angle, and \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle ds2 c2dt2 dr2 r2 d\u03b82 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 . 13 Thus the coordinate system changed but the metric still describes \ufb02at space. In contrast, consider the surface of a 2D sphere of radius R embedded in a \ufb02at 3D space. The spatial part of the metric would then be ds2 R2 d\u03b82 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 . 14 It is easy to show that this represents a closed surface with \ufb01nite area and no boundary. We 4 Figure 2 Examples of di\ufb00erent spacetime ge ometries described by the FRW metric. In white is an equilateral triangle. Black arrows indicate how initially parallel geodesics will behave. Top Flat Space. The angles of a triangle drawn on this plane add up to exactly 180 degrees. If the Universe has zero curva ture, then its geometry is the ordinary 3D Eu clidean space that we are most familiar with. Middle The surface of a sphere is \ufb01nite, but it doesn t have an edge. The angles of a spher ical triangle add up to more than 180 degrees. If the Universe has positive curvature, then its geometry is the 3D analogue of a sphere. Bottom The surface of a saddle. The angles of a triangle drawn on this saddle add up to less than 180 degrees. If the Universe has neg ative curvature, then its geometry is the 3D analogue of an in\ufb01nite saddle. can introduce a new radial coordinate r Rsin \u03b8, then dr R cos \u03b8d\u03b8 1 r R 2 1 2 d\u03b8, 15 and the line element in eqn. 14 can be rewritten as ds2 dr2 1 r R 2 r2d\u03c62. 16 Now note that this metric has the exact same form as the spatial part of the Robertson Walker metric in eqn. 7 modulo the scale factor a2 , provided that we identify d\u03c62 d\u21262, take k 1, and identify R, the radius of our sphere, with the radius of curvature R0 discussed previously. Whereas the equation above is for a 2D spherical surface which we can visualize as being embedded in 3 space , eqn. 4 actually corresponds to a 3D spherical volume which, just like the 2D sphere, is spatially closed and has a \ufb01nite volume with no boundary. It is possible to convert this to the metric for the 2D analog of a constant negative curvature surface by considering an imaginary radius of curvature R iR. In this case k 1 and the metric takes the form ds2 dr2 1 r R 2 r2d\u03c62. 17 5 Hilbert proved that a two dimensional surface of uniform negative curvature cannot be em bedded in a three dimensional Euclidean space, so this is not something you can easily visualize. Maybe that is not so surprising, since the hyperbolic space described by this metric has in\ufb01nite area. The saddle shape illustrated in Fig 2 has uniform negative curvature only in the central region, near the seat of the saddle. Finally, the Euclidean case of zero curvature is the case k 0 which you can think of as the limit where the radius of curvature R . As we will see observations indicate that k 0 to very high precision, so for the purposes of this course we will work primarily with the Euclidean case. 3 Proper Distance, Redshift, and Hubble Drag 3.1 Proper Distance Consider a galaxy su\ufb03ciently far away from us that that we can consider the Universe as uniform on this scale and thus well described by the RW metric. In an expanding universe, the distance between two objects is increasing with time as illustrated by the simple example in 1. The proper distance rp between two points is equal to the length of the spacelike geodesic a geodesic with dt 0 between them at some instant in cosmic time t, such that we can consider dt 0 and the scale factor to be \ufb01xed at the value a t , which implies ds2 a2 t dr2 ds a t dr 18 where we have assumed the angle \u03b8,\u03c6 is equal to a constant along this geodesic such that d\u21262 0. The proper distance rp is obtained by integrating over the radial comoving coordinate r rp t a t r 0 dr a t r. 19 Thus the proper distance rp t is a function of time but the comoving distance r is not. You can think of the comoving distance as being distance measured in units of the grid cells in Fig. 1. Although the proper length of the cell side expands with time, distances in units of these cells are constant. The rate of change of proper distance between any two points is vp t rp t a t r a arp H t rp, 20 where we have used the time dependent Hubble expanstion rate H t a a. The equation above implies that at any time t there is a linear relation between the proper distance to a galaxy and its recession speed which is referred to as the Hubble \ufb02ow. At the present time t t0 we de\ufb01ne H t0 H0, which has the observationally determined value of 68 2 km s 1 Mpc 1. Again this idea of a constant comoving distance r, the scale factor a t , and the resulting linear relation between velocity vp and proper distance rp are just 6 repetitions of the discussion in 1 of the expanding picture pattern, but now expressed more formally in terms of the metric. 3.2 Light Propagation and Redshift To analyse the observations of light from distant objects we need to account for the fact that the wavelength of the light gets stretched or, equivalently, the photons lose energy due to the expansion of the universe, which is known as redshift. We can work out how redshift relates to a t . Let us consider the time it takes light to travel along a null geodesic with ds2 0. Suppose the light is emitted at t tem at position rand travels to position 0 where it arrives at time t tobs. Note that because of isotropy and homogeneity we can always choose to orient our coordinate system so that \u03b8and \u03c6will be constant. Since photons travel along null geodesics with ds2 0 we have cdt a t dr tobs tem cdt a t 0 r dr r. 21 Now let us also consider a second signal emitted just slightly later at tem tem and received at tobs tobs r tobs tobs tem tem cdt a t , tobs tem cdt a t tem tem tem cdt a t tobs tobs tobs cdt a t tobs tem cdt a t c tem a tem c tobs a tobs . 22 Since r is a comoving coordinate which by construction has not changed with time, both eqn. 21 and eqn. 22 are equal to r. This implies that tobs a tobs a tem tem. Now imagine that the time interval we considered tem to be at di\ufb00erent crests of an electro magnetic wave so that tem can be identi\ufb01ed with the period Tem 1 \u03bdem \u03bbem c. We can also choose tobs to be the present day so that the scale factor a tobs 1, which is how we generally normalize the scale factor at the present epoch. The previous equation can then be rewritten as \u03bbobs a tem 1\u03bbem 1 z \u03bbem 23 where we have de\ufb01ned a tem 1 1 z . The expansion of the Universe implies light must redshift! 7 3.3 Peculiar Velocity and Hubble Drag As we will see later, small perturbations in the background energy density distribution cause the growth of structures, which in turn induce velocities that deviate from pure expansion. These velocities with respect to the cosmological rest frame of the fundamental observers are called peculiar velocities. The proper velocity with respect to a fundamental observer at the origin is vp drp dt, where vp drp dt d dt a t r t a t r t a t r t vexp vpec 24 where we have used eqn. 19 for rp and the comoving distance r t is now a function of time beacuse of the presence of a peculiar velocity, such that r t is the comoving peculiar velocity and a t r t converts this to a proper peculiar velocity vpec. Xtime t !observer Vpec t Xtime t dt !d\u2113 Vpec t dt Figure 3 A particle X with peculiar velocity vpec observed by an observer Oat two di\ufb00erent times, t and t t dt. Now imagine that there is a particle which is moving with a proper peculiar velocity vpec. It will gradually overtake objects in the Hubble \ufb02ow owing to its peculiar velocity, but since in an expanding universe objects at larger distances are moving faster because of the the universal expansion, its peculiar velocity will appear to decelerate from the perspective of a fundamental observer who is in the Hubble \ufb02ow. To be more precise consider the diagram in Fig. 3. A fundamental observer Oobserves a particle X traveling with peculiar velocity vpec t . An in\ufb01tesimal interval dt of time later at time t dt the particle X has traveled to a new location d\u2113 away from Oand has a new peculiar velocity vpec t dt . The quesiton we aim to answer is how does vpec t change with time? To answer this consider that from the perspective ofO, the particle P has no forces acting on it, and because special relativity applies over these in\ufb01testimal intervals we are considering, 8 P cannot have been accelerated, and since the proper velocities are physical velocities we must have vp t vp t dt where vp is the proper velocity measured by O. At time t vp t vpec t , 25 since there is no expansion contribution since Ois a fundamental observer moving with the Hubble \ufb02ow and r t 0 the comoving separation between the particle X and O at t 0. Whereas at time t dt vp t dt vexp t dt vpec t dt H t dt d\u2113 vpec t dt H t vpec t dt vpec t dt . 26 Here we have written the expansion term in terms of the Hubble constant, and in the last approximation we have used d\u2113 vpec t dt and Taylor expanded working only to linear order in small quantities. Equating vp t vp t dt , we \ufb01nd vpec t dt vpec H t vpec t dt 27 or dvpec dt Hvpec. 28 Thus we see that from the perspective of O, the peculiar velocity of particle X decreases with time, which is known as Hubble drag. We can rearrange this equation slightly to obtain dvpec dt dvpec da a a avpec dvpec da 1 avpec. 29 Taking the dot product of the equation above with vpec one obtains dvpec da vpec 1 2 dv2 pec da 1 av2 pec dv2 pec v2 pec 2da a 30 It is easy to show that this implies ln vpec vpec,0 ln a a0 31 or vpec a 1. 32 One can also show that the relativistic generalization of this is that p a 1 where p is the momentum. For a particle moving at v c, we already derived this...it s called redshift! In other words, since photon momentum depends on wavelength, p h \u03bb, the redshifting of light as the Universe expands \u03bb a implies the same p a 1 reduction in momentum. Whereas our prevous deriviation of the redshift treated light as an electromagnetic wave with crests and troughs, this derivation in terms of momentum also applies to the quantum mechanical treatment of light as photons. 9 4 Horizons The size of a causally connected patch of space is determined by how far light can travel in a certain amount of time. As we mentioned previously in 3.2, light travels along null geodesics with ds2 0 and we have from the FRW metric cdt a t dr, 33 where t is cosmic time, r is the comoving distance, and we orient our coordinate system to have d\u21262 0. In this context it is convenient to make a change of variables which de\ufb01nes the conformal time d\u03c4 dt a t . 34 Integrating both sides, we see that along a null geodesic one then has r c \u03c4, 35 where the plus sign corresponds to outgoing photons and the minus sign to incoming photons. The advantage of the conformal time is that in these coordinates the propagation of light in the FRW metric looks the same as it does in Minkowski space c t x, namely light rays travel along straight lines at 45 angles in r \u03c4 coordinates assuming c 1 as is customary in relativity , whereas had we used the cosmic time t the light cones in a curved spacetime would be curved. We are now in a position to de\ufb01ne two di\ufb00erent types of cosmological horizons. One which limits the distances at which past events can be observed and another which limits the distances at which it will ever be possible to in\ufb02uence events in the future. Because signals cannot travel faster than the speed of light, these horizons then also determine the sizes of causally connected regions of spacetime. 4.1 Particle Horizon According to eqn. 35 , the maximum comoving distance that light can travel between two conformal times \u03c41 and \u03c42 \u03c41 is simply r c \u03c4. Hence if the Big Bang started with a singularity at ti 0, then the largest comoving distance from which an observer at time t will be able to receive a signal traveling at the speed of light is given by rph \u03c4 c \u03c4 \u03c4i t ti cdt a t , 36 which is known as the comoving particle horizon . The size of the particle horizon at time \u03c4 can be visualised by the intersection of the past light cone of an observer p with the spacelike hypersurface i.e. constant time \u03c4 \u03c4i, which corresponds to the Big Bang as illustrated in Figure 4. Notice that the Big Bang singularity is a moment in time, but not a point in space, which explains why we illustrate the singularity by an extended possibly in\ufb01nite spacelike hypersurface in Figure 4. Causal in\ufb02uences have to come from within this 10 region. Only comoving particles whose worldlines intersect the past light cone of pcan send a signal to an observer at p. The boundary of the region containing such worldlines is the particle horizon at p. Notice that every observer has his or her own particle horizon. 4.2 Event Horizon Just as there are past events that we cannot see now, there may be regions of space in the future that we will never be able to in\ufb02uence. In comoving coordinates, the largest distance from which an observer at some future time tf will receive signals emitted at any time later than an earlier time t is given by reh \u03c4 c \u03c4f \u03c4 tf t cdt a t , 37 which is called the comoving event horizon. It is conceptually similar to the event horizon of black holes in that it de\ufb01nes a maximum distance out to which a signal can ever travel. Here, \u03c4f denotes the \ufb01nal moment of conformal time . Notice that \u03c4f may be \ufb01nite even if the \ufb01nal moment of physical time is in\ufb01nite tf . Indeed, whether or not this is the case depends on the form of a t . In particular, \u03c4f is \ufb01nite for our universe if dark energy is really a cosomological constant. 11 Figure 4 Spacetime diagram illustrating the concept of horizons. The x axis is comoving distance and the y axis is conformal time. Dotted lines show the worldlines of comoving objects. The particle horizon is the maximal distance from which we can receive signals. Thus the shaded region indicates regions of spacetime that are causally connected to us. The event horizon is the maximal distance to which we can send a signal. The speed of light is assumed to be unity in this diagram such that light travels along world lines oriented at a 45 angle. 12 Figure 5 Light cone in x, y, t space. An event which is at the origin x y 0 at the present time t0 will follow some world line into the future, always remaining inside the future light cone. All points on the world line are at timelike locations with respect to the spatial origin at t0. World lines for light signals emitted from received at the origin at t0 will propagate on the envelope of the future past light cone. No signals can be sent to or received from spacelike locations. The space in the past from which signals can be received at the present origin is restricted by the particle horizon at tmin, the earliest time under consideration. The event horizon restricts the space which can at present be in causal relation to the present spatial origin at some future time tmax. Figure from Roos. 13",

Einstein s \ufb01eld equation plays a role in general relativity that is analogous to Poisson s equation in Newtonian dynamics. Poisson s equation, 2\u03a6 4\u03c0G\u03c1, 1 tells you how to compute the gravitational potential \u03a6 given the mass density\u03c1. Analogously, Einstein s \ufb01eld equation is G\u00b5\u03bd 8\u03c0G c4 T\u00b5\u03bd, 2 where G\u00b5\u03bd is the Einstein tensor, which is a 4 4 symmetric tensor which depends on derivatives of the metricg\u00b5\u03bd, and T\u00b5\u03bd is the stress energy tensor, sometimes also called the energy momentum tensor, which quanti\ufb01es the density of energy and momentum and how they \ufb02ow. The tensors are symmetric, so the result is ten nonlinear second order di\ufb00erential equations. Given the stress energy tensor, one can solve the \ufb01eld equation for the metric g\u00b5\u03bd determining how mass energy tells space how to curve. Armed with the metric one can then determine particle trajectories via the geodesic equation , which depends on derivatives of the metric. Spacetime thus tells mass energy how to move, and the geodesic equation is the analog of taking the gradient of the gravitational potential to determine the Newtonian force on a particle. Solutions to the Einsten \ufb01eld equation can be extremely complicated. However, in the cosmological context the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy dramatically simplify the problem. Recall the RW metric ds2 c2dt2 a2 t dr2 Sk r d\u21262 , 3 where Sk r R0 sin r R0 k 1 r k 0 R0 sinh r R0 k 1. 4 So for our present purposes, we need to understand how the energy denstiy \u03c1 and pressure P of the material in the universe determine the scale factor a t , the curvature constant k, and R0 the radius of curvature at the present epoch. 1 The Friedmann Equation The equation of motion for the scale factor a t known as the Friedmann equation can be derived in a quasi Newtonian fashion. The cosmological principle states that the the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic when aveaged over su\ufb03ciently large scales. It thus follows that its global properties such as density and pressure at any time must be the same as those in 1 some volume su\ufb03ciently small 1 that Newtonian physics is valid but su\ufb03ciently large that homogeneity and isotropy still hold . Consider such a small spherical region of \ufb01xed mass M enclosed within radius R. Homogeneity and isotropy imply that the acceleration of a test particle at R should obey R GM R2 , 5 Note that, because of the homogeneity, there is no force due to pressure gradients and that only the mass within the sphere is relevant for the dynamics of R. This follows directly from Birkho\ufb00 s theorem, according to which the gravitational acceleration at any radius in a spherically symmetric system depends only on the mass within that radius. We can multiply each side of this equation by R and integrate once to obtain 1 2 R2 GM R E. 6 Here E is a constant of integration which equals the energy per unit mass of a test particle at R. Now using the fact that the mass of the sphere is a constant equal to M 4\u03c0\u03c1 t R t 3 3, where \u03c1 t is the mass density, we can rewrite the equation above as 1 2 R2 4\u03c0G\u03c1R2 3 E, 7 If we now de\ufb01ne R a t R0, where R0 is independent of t, it then follows H2 t a a 2 8\u03c0G\u03c1 3 kc2 R2 0a2 , 8 where wave have introduced a new integration constant, k 2E c2, to be identi\ufb01ed with the curvature constant in the RW metric in eqn. 4 . The equation above is known as theFriedmann equationand is one of the two fundamental equations describing the expansion of the universe. Although we derived it classically, its form is identical to the equation resulting from the proper treatment of GR. There are however two important di\ufb00erences that only a full relativistic treatment can elucidate. First, the fully relativistic version of eqn. 5 for the acceleration from which we derived the Friedmann equation is R 4\u03c0G 3 R \u03c1 3P c2 , 9 which encodes the fact that in GR pressure gravitates and the active energy density that sources gravity is now \u03c1 3P c2. This equation for the acceleration and the Friedmann equation eqn. 8 in fact arise as independent equations from di\ufb00erent components of the Einstein equation. The Friedmann equation turns out to be identical to our classical result provided that \u03c1 is taken as the energy density of anything, i.e. mass energy, radiation, 1By small here we mean relative to the Hubble radiuscH 1 0 and if the universe is curvedk 0 then also to the radius of curvatureR0 cH 1 0 . 2 or vacuum energy note that following convention, we write \u03c1 as a mass density which is e\ufb00ectively the energy density divided by c2 . But this dependence on pressure implies that one needs one more piece of information in order to solve for the universe s dynamics, namely the equation of state of each energy component P \u03c1 which we will come to next. The second di\ufb00erence between the classical treatment and GR is that classically the energy E and radius R0 of this shell are arbitrary initial conditions at t 0. Whereas in the full derivation from GR the curvature constant k is uniquely determined to be k 1, 1, or 0 and R0 is the radius of curvature of the universe if k 0 , both of which are determined by the mass energy contents of the universe. This profound connection between the geometry of the universe and its energy contents cannot be fully captured classically. To understand the physical implications of this relationship between geometry and mass energy it helps to de\ufb01ne the critical density \u03c1c and the density parameter \u2126 t \u03c1c t 3H2 t 8\u03c0G and \u2126 t \u03c1 \u03c1c 10 such that the Friedmann equation eqn. 8 , can be written 1 \u2126 t kc2 R2 0a2 t H2 t 11 which can be rearranged k \u2126 t 1 R0a2 t cH 1 t 2 . 12 In this form, one more clearly sees how the curvature is related to the energy contents. There are three possibilities that can be distinguished provided one can measure the value of \u2126 t at any time spatially open if at any time \u2126 t 1 then this implies k 0 and the universe has negative curvature hyperbolic geometry . spatially closed if at any time \u2126 t 1 then this implies k 0 and the universe has positive curvature spherical geometry . spatially \ufb02at if at any time \u2126 t 1 then this implies k 0 and the universe is \ufb02at and the geometry is Euclidean. The current best constraints on \u2126 0 \u2126 t t0 come from the combining the Planck CMB measurements with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements. They indicate that the universe is conistent with being spatially \ufb02at to very high precision \u2126 0 0.999 0.002. So for the rest of this course we will always assume k 0 implying that the geometry is Euclidean and allowing us to use the simplest form of the RW metric where Sk r r. 3 2 The Fluid Equation We argued that the Friedmann equation encapsulates the idea of energy conservation that is the gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy of expansion must equal a constant. Let s consider another classical manifestation of energy conservation which is the \ufb01rst law of thermodynamics dQ TdS dU PdV, 13 where dQ is the heat \ufb02ow into or out of a volume V, dU is the change in internal energy, P is the pressure and dV is the change in volume. Homogeneity requires that there is no bulk \ufb02ow of heat dQ 0, which is to say that the expansion of the universe is adiabatic. Dividing the equation above by dt implies U P V 0. 14 Consider a sphere of comoving radius rc expanding with the universal Hubble expansion, its proper radius will be rp a t rc, and the proper volume of this sphere to which the \ufb01rst law of thermodynamics should apply is V t 4\u03c0 3 r3 ca3 t V 4\u03c0 3 r3 c 3a2 a V 3 a a . 15 The internal energy of the sphere is U t V\u03c1 t c2 U c2 V \u03c1 V\u03c1 c2V \u03c1 3\u03c1 a a , 16 where \u03c1 is again the total mass energy density and we used eqn. 15 for V. Combining eqns. 14 16 gives the \ufb01nal result \u03c1 3 a a \u03c1 P c2 0, 17 which is known as the \ufb02uid equation or the continuity equation, and is the second key equation, in addition to the Friedmann equation, for describing the expansion of the Universe. This important equation can also be thought of as describing energy conservation in the cosmological context. Notice that the classical notion of energy conservation is expressed by the continuity equation \u03c1 \u03c0, which states that the rate of change of energy density equals the negative divergence of the energy \ufb02ux \u03c0. This can be derived via Noether s theorem because of symmetry under time translations. However, this symmetry is broken in an expanding spacetime, so the standard notion of energy conservation does not have to hold and is replaced by eqn. 17 . Let s now consider what happens when we combine these two key equations, i.e. the Fried mann equation in eqn. 8 and the \ufb02uid equation above. Let s start with the Friedmann 4 equation multiplied through by a2 a2 8\u03c0G 3 \u03c1a2 kc2 R2 0 . 18 Taking the time derivative yields 2 a a 8\u03c0G 3 \u03c1a2 2\u03c1a a . 19 Dividing by 2 aa gives a a 4\u03c0G 3 \u03c1a a 2\u03c1 . 20 Combining with the \ufb02uid equation eqn. 17 we \ufb01nally obtain a a 4\u03c0G 3 \u03c1 3P c2 . 21 which is the fully relativistic version of the acceleration equation see eqn. 9 , which as mentioned previously, indicates that pressure as well as energy are sources of gravitational acceleration. 3 Equations of State and Energy Density Evolution To recap, we have discussed three equations that describe the expansion of the universe H2 t 8\u03c0G\u03c1 3 kc2 R2 0a2 Friedmann equation \u03c1 3 a a \u03c1 P c2 0 \ufb02uid equation a a 4\u03c0G 3 \u03c1 3P c2 acceleration equation. 22 Only two of these are independent since we ve just seen that we can obtain the acceleration equation by combining the other two. These two independent equations however depend on three unknown functions a t , \u03c1 t and P t , so we clearly need another equation to solve for the evolution of the universe. Speci\ufb01cally, what we need is an equation of state, which is a relationship between the pressure P and energy density \u03c1, P \u03c1 , for whatever forms of energy \ufb01ll the universe. In principle there may be many di\ufb00erent sources contributing to the energy density of the Universe matter both non relativistic and relativistic , radiation, dark energy, scalar \ufb01elds, etc. As we shall see later the Universe transited from a radiation dominated phase early on to a matter dominated phase at later stages. In addition, the Universe has become dominated by dark energy in the recent past. We therefore focus on these three energy components and 5 write the total energy density \u03c1c2 \u03c1m c2 \u03f5 matter radiation 4\u03c3SB c T4 \u03c1de dark energy , 23 where the \u03c1m is the mass density, \u03f5 is the internal energy of the matter per unit mass i.e. \u03f5 3kBTm 2m for a monatomic ideal gas, where kB is Boltzmann s constant, and Tm is the temperature of the matter , T is the radiation \ufb01eld temperature, and \u03c1de is the dark energy density. The pressure associated with any of these energy components is expressed according to an equation of state. Becuase cosmology only deals with dilute gases the equation of state always takes a simple linear form P w\u03c1c2, 24 where w is a dimensionless number. Plugging this form into the \ufb02uid equation above see eqn. 22 \u03c1 3 a a \u03c1 w\u03c1 0, 25 which can be rearranged to give d\u03c1 \u03c1 3 1 w da a . 26 Provided that w is a constant we can integrate to obtain \u03c1 \u03c10a 3 1 w , 27 were \u03c10 is the energy density of some component of the energy density i.e. matter, radiation, dark energy at the present epoch i.e. a0 1 . Let s consider each component in slightly more detail. 3.1 Matter To describe matter consider approximating the Universe as an ideal gas consisting of N particles of mass m such that PmV NkBT, \u03c1m mN V and hence Pm kBT m \u03c1m. 28 Note that w kBT m since \u03c1m \u03c1. To determine w it is useful to write the equation of state of the ideal gas as a function of the adibatic index \u03b3. Recall that for an ideal gas Pm \u03b3 1 \u03c1m\u03f5 29 where \u03f5is the internal energy per unit mass. For example for a monatomic ideal gas \u03b3 5 3, \u03f5 3kBT 2m , and we recover the ideal gas law above for the pressure eqn. 28 . 6 We can make it explicit that in the non relativistic limit , the rest mass energy does not contribute to the gas pressure by noting that the total energy density \u03c1c2 \u03c1m c2 \u03f5 and rewriting the equation above as Pm \u03b3 1 \u03c1c2 \u03c1mc2 30 Combining eqns 28 and 30 we can write Pm kBT mc2 1 1 \u03b3 1 kBT mc2 1 \u03c1c2, 31 which implies w T kBT mc2 1 1 \u03b3 1 kBT mc2 1 . 32 Since for a non relativistic gas kBT mc2, we immediately see that w T 1. in other words a non relativistic gas is well approximated by a \ufb02uid with zero pressure w 0 which is often referred to as a dust \ufb02uid. Since \u03c1 a 3 1 w a dust \ufb02uid has \u03c1 a 3 as expected. In other words, since the internal energy is negligible compared to the mass energy, it is only the dilution of the number of particles per proper volume that causes the mass energy density to decrease with the Universe s expansion. To understand how the Universe s expansion alters the temperature of this \ufb02uid we use kinetic theory which relates gas temperature to the random peculiar motions of the gas particles kBT m v2 . We learned previously that momentum and velocity redshift away as v a 1, thus we obtain T a 2. 3.2 Radiation At early times the energy density of the universe is dominated by contributions from a hot plasma comprised of relativistic particles and radiation in thermal equilibrium at temperature T. To determine the equation of state and scalings with redshift during this period we approximate the energy density as arising from an ultra relativistic \ufb02uid of particles for which P \u03c1c2 3 w 1 3. 33 This is just the familiar relationship between pressure and energy density for radiation, which an ultra relativistic \ufb02uid must clearly approximate. It can be derived explicitly by writing down the expressions for P and \u03c1 for Bose Einstein and Fermi Dirac statistics and carrying out the phase space integrals in the relativistic limit, which we will come to in a few lectures. We see then from eqn. 27 that for radiation \u03c1 a 4. For a black body radiation \ufb01eld \u03c1 T4 see eqn. 23 which then implies that T a 1. Note the di\ufb00erence between the temperature scaling for radiation and that that for a non relativistic ideal gas Tm a 2 that we derived above. This important result explains how the cosmic microwave background CMB radiation maintains its blackbody form as the Universe expands. Prior to recombination the radiation 7 is in thermal equilibrium with the matter due to the tight coupling provided by Thompson scattering o\ufb00 of electrons. This black body spectrum is frozen in after recombination when the opacity vanishes and photons are released. The number of photons is then simply conserved not true for a true black body , and the \u03c1 a 4 results from the intuitive explanation that the number of photons is a constant and the number density dilutes as a 3, but the extra factor of a arises from the redshifting away of photon energy caused as the Universe expands, i.e. E h\u03bd, with \u03bd a 1. We will derive this result more formally using statistical mechanics in a few lectures. 3.3 Dark Energy In classical physics there is no way for a vacuum to have energy. But quantum \ufb01eld theory permits particle antiparticle pairs to spontaneously appear and then annihilate from the vacuum. Just as there is an energy density associated with real particles in the Universe, there is an energy density \u03c1vac associated with the virtual particle antiparticle pairs. One can then argue that the vacuum energy density \u03c1vac is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that only depends on the energy di\ufb00erence between the true and false vacua and knows nothing about the expansion of the Universe and thus \u03c1vac must be independent of time. It then follows from the \ufb02uid equation eqn. 22 , that for vacuum energy since \u03c1 \u03c10a 3 1 w const. P \u03c1c2. 34 This concept of negative pressure can be di\ufb03cult to wrap your mind around. One way to build physical intuition is to recall the \ufb01rst law of thermodynamics eqn. 14 dU PdV 0. 35 If the vacuum is to have a positive energy density associated with it then expanding space creates more vacuum and hence more energy. This requires that work be done dU PdV 0 \u03c1vacc2dV PvacdV Pvac \u03c1vacc2. 36 This vacuum energy results in anti gravity that causes the expansion of the Universe to accelerate. From the acceleration equation if Pvac \u03c1vacc2 a a 4\u03c0G 3 \u03c1 3P c2 8\u03c0G 3 \u03c1vac. 37 More generally we can see that, assuming an equation of state P w\u03c1c2 a a 4\u03c0G 3 \u03c1 3P c2 4\u03c0G 3 1 3w \u03c1. 38 Thus if w 1 3 then a 0 and the expansion will accelerate. Any energy component that satis\ufb01es this criteria for its equation of state is referred to as dark energy. Table 3.3 indicates how each of the mass energy components we have discussed scales with 8 redshift. Table 1 Scalings with Scale Factor of Dominant Mass Energy Components. Dominant components w \u03c1 P T matter 0 a 3 a 5 a 2 radiation 1 3 a 4 a 4 a 1 vacuum energy 1 a0 a0 4 The Friedmann Equation in terms of \u2126s Using what we have learned about how di\ufb00erent forms of energy matter, radiation, vacuum energy dilute with the expansion we can rewrite the Friedmann equation H2 t a a 2 8\u03c0G 3 \u03c1m,0a 3 \u03c1r,0a 4 \u03c1\u039b,0 kc2 R0a2 , 39 where zero subscripts indicate the energy density in matter, radiation, and vacuum energy at the present epoch t t0 where the scale factor a t0 1. Evaluating this at t t0 then gives H2 0 t 8\u03c0G 3 \u03c1m,0 \u03c1r,0 \u03c1\u039b,0 kc2 R0 , 40 or expressing the present day total energy in terms of the critical density today\u03c1c t0 3H2 0 8\u03c0G de\ufb01ned in eqn. 10 \u21260 \u03c1m,0 \u03c1r,0 \u03c1\u039b,0 \u03c1c t0 \u2126m,0 \u2126r,0 \u2126\u039b,0, 41 where i.e. \u2126 m,0 \u03c1m,0 \u03c1c t0 , and so on. Then the Friedmann equation at t t0 becomes \u2126k,0 kc2 R2 0H2 0 1 \u21260, 42 and we can recast the Friedmann equation at any time t or equivalently scale factor a as H2 a H2 0 \u2126m,0a 3 \u2126r,0a 4 \u2126\u039b,0 \u2126k,0a 2 , 43 or H z H0E z , 44 where E z \u2126m,0a 3 \u2126r,0a 4 \u2126\u039b,0 \u2126k,0a 2 1 2 . 45 Finally, recalling the de\ufb01nition \u2126 t \u03c1 t \u03c1c t in eqn. 10 , we can also de\ufb01ne time de pendent \u2126 s for each component, i.e. \u2126 m z \u03c1m z \u03c1c z , allowing us to also write the 9 Friedmann equation as \u2126m z \u2126r z \u2126\u039b z \u2126k z 1. 46 10",

Once the expansion history is determined we can evaluate the distances and time between two points, and we will see that there are many ways to do so in an expanding Universe. 1 Densities at Present Previously we de\ufb01ned the density parameters of matter, radiation, and dark energy at the present time relative to the critical density \u03c1c t0 3H2 0 8\u03c0G 9.2 10 30 h 0.70 2 g cm 3 1.4 1011 h 0.70 2 M Mpc 3, 1 such that \u2126m,0 \u03c1m,0 \u03c1c,0, etc. We saw that in terms of these \u2126 s the Friedmann equation is H2 z H2 0 \u2126m,0a 3 \u2126r,0a 4 \u2126v,0 \u2126k,0a 2 , 2 or H z H0E z , 3 where E z \u2126m,0a 3 \u2126r,0a 4 \u2126v,0 \u2126k,0a 2 1 2 . 4 We then argued that since the universe is observed to be \ufb02at k 0 the Friedmann equation evaluated at the present epoch implies \u2126 k,0 kc2 R2 0 H2 0 0 such that \u21260 \u2126m,0 \u2126r,0 \u2126v,0 1 5 A combination of various di\ufb00erent cosmological observations point to a benchmark model for which \u2126m,0 0.30 and \u2126v,0 0.70 and \u2126r,0 8.6 10 5. We now discuss each component in more detail. 1.1 Radiation What about the radiation? Well the numbers above suggest it is negligibly small, which it is at the present epoch. To be more precise, we will refer to this as the relativistic component to account for the fact that it can include more than just photons. The relativistic component is dominated by the CMB which is, to high accuracy, a black body at temperatureT\u03b3 2.73 K. A black body radiation \ufb01eld is described by the black body function, and it has an energy density \u03c1\u03b3c2 4\u03c3SBT4 c \u03c3SB \u03c02k4 B 60\u210f3c2 , 6 1 where \u03c3SB is the Stefan Boltzmann constant. We will explicitly derive the expression above later from statistical mechanics when we discuss thermal history. Plugging in numbers, we obtain \u03c1\u03b3,0 4.7 10 34 g cm 3 or \u2126\u03b3,0 5.1 10 5. 7 Note that the background radiation in starlight is about an order of magnitude lower than that contributed by the CMB so it can be safely neglected. Recall that the CMB is a relic from the time when the Universe was hot and dense enough to be opaque due to Thompson scattering to photons. If we extrapolate further back, we reach a time when the Universe was hot and dense enough to be opaque to neutrinos. What this means is that various interactions between neutrinos, leptons, and baryons kept the neutrinos tightly coupled to and in thermal equilibrium with the primordial radiation bath that dominates the energy density of the Universe. There is thus an equivalent background of relic cosmic neutrinos which we will treat as radiation , since the the neutrino mass is su\ufb03ciently small m\u03bdc2 0.1 eV that we can assume they are relativistic. The energy density of the cosmic neutrino background should be comparable to that of the photons. We will prove this explicitly later when we discuss thermal history, but intuitively this makes sense if you consider that relativistic gases in statsitical equilbrium ought to be in equipartition just like a non relativistic ideal gas. We will show that the cosmic neutrino background has a temperature comparable to but lower than the CMB T\u03bd 4 11 1 3 T\u03b3, 8 and that the corresponding energy density is \u03c1\u03bd 3 7 8 4 11 4 3 \u03c1\u03b3, 9 where the factor of 3 comes from the three left handed neutrino \ufb02avors, the factor of 7 8 comes from the fact that since neutrinos are fermions their statistical weights are slightly di\ufb00erent than photons which are bosons, and the 4 11 4 3 comes from the T4 dependence of the energy density and eqn. 8 for T\u03bd. Adding in the contribution from neutrinos, we thus \ufb01nd that \u03c1r,0 7.8 10 34 g cm 3 or \u2126 r,0 8.6 10 5. 10 1.2 Matter Radiation Equality Now we have seen that at the present epoch \u2126r,0 \u2126m,0. However given that \u03c1m a 3 and \u03c1r a 4, there is some point in the past before which radiation dominated see Fig. 1 . We can determine when this occurred by calculating the time at which \u03c1m,0a 3 \u03c1r,0a 4 aeq 1 1 zeq \u03c1r,0 \u03c1m,0 \u2126r,0 \u2126m,0 11 2 which is known as matter radiation equality. Plugging in numbers we \ufb01nd 1 zeq 3500 \u2126m,0 0.30 h 0.70 2 12 1.3 The Coincidence Problem We can similarly ask when did the dark energy \u2126 \u039b,0 0.70 begin to dominate over matter \u2126m,0 0.30, since matter density scales as a 3 in the Friedmann equation whereas the dark energy remains constant with time. This equality occurs at 1 zm\u039b 1.33 \u2126\u039b,0 \u2126m,0 0.70 0.30 1 3 13 or zm\u039b 0.33, which is actually pretty recent see Fig. 1 . This raises the question of why dark energy is just starting to dominate the expansion rate now, or equivalently why \u03c1\u039b,0 \u03c1m,0 O 1 , which has been referred to as the coincidence problem1. The argument goes that one needs very special initial conditions in the early universe for this to be the case. Explanations for how this could more naturally arise abound. One example is postulating that the energy density of dark energy somehow tracks that in matter. Another is invoking an anthropic argument, i.e. in some ensemble of universes only those in which dark energy comes on the scene late would result in intelligent life that could observe the Universe. None of these explanations are particularly appealing but it is safe to say the coincidence problem is not keeping most cosmologists up at night. 2 Model Universes Consider the simplifying assumption that the Universe is dominated by a single energy com ponent. In this case the solutions to the Friedmann equation are analytic and is instructive to compute them. Assume a \ufb02at universe \ufb01lled with a single substance X whose equation of state parameter w implies that it dilutes as \u03c1X a 3 1 w , 14 as we argued previously from the \ufb02uid equation. In this case the Friedmann equation sim pli\ufb01es to H2 a a a 2 H2 0 \u2126X,0a 3 1 w a2 H2 0 \u2126X,0a 1 3w , 15 where H0 is the present day value of the expansion rate and \u2126 X,0 \u03c1X,0 \u03c1c t0 . Note that even though this single component approximation is not valid at the present epoch, we are still free to normalize the energy components in terms of \u03c1c,0 using the present day value of the Hubble constant, explaining the appearance of H0 and \u2126X,0 in the equation above. 1See https arxiv.org abs 1410.2509 for a discussion 3 Figure 1 Left Evolution of \u03c1 \u03c1c t t0 for radiation, matter, and dark energy. Notice the the di\ufb00erent slopes a 4, a 3, and a0 for the di\ufb00erent components, respectively. Right Evolu tion of \u2126 z , the fraction of the critical density contributed by each mass energy component of the universe as a function of redshift for a \ufb02at i.e. k 0 or \u2126k 0 universe. Recall that \u2126m z \u2126r z \u2126\u039b z 1. Figures taken from https arxiv.org abs 1410.2509. To solve this equation we assume a power law form for the time dependence of the scale factor a t t t0 q , 16 from which we conclude that q 2 3 3w t0 2 3 3w H 1 0 \u2126X,0 2 3 3w 3 8\u03c0G\u03c1X,0 1 2 , 17 with the restriction that w 1, which requires a separate treatment. 2.1 Radiation Dominated At z zeq the energy density will be entirely dominated by radiation see Fig. 1 and we can apply eqn. 17 with w 1 3 appropriate for radiation and \u2126 r,0 from eqn. 10 . This yields q 1 2 and thus a t t t0 1 2 , 18 where t0 2.4 1019 s 750 Gyr. Using the previously derived scalings \u03c1r a 4, and Tr a 1 results in the rough scalings 4 for the radiation dominated early universe T 1010 K kBT 1 MeV \u03c1r 107 g cm 3 1 4 1 z 1010 t 1 s 1 2 . 19 These relations are approximately correct for 0 t 1010 s, or z 105. The arbitrarily high temperatures and densities which are achieved at su\ufb03ciently early times have given this standard cosmological model its generic name, the Hot Big Bang. 2.2 Matter Dominated As indicated by the right panel of Fig. 1, for cosmic times z zeq and z zm\u039b, i.e. roughly in the range 2 z 300 it is a good approximation to treat the universe as being matter dominated. During this phase, again assuming a \ufb02at universe, the scale factor is well approximated by a t t t0 2 3 , 20 where t0 2H 1 0 3 \u2126m,0 . For the case \u2126\u039b,0 0 \u2126m,0 1 this is known as the Einstein de Sitter EdS solution. 2.3 Lambda Dominated Consider a spatially \ufb02at universe for which the energy density is contributed only by dark energy with equation of state w 1, i.e. Then the Friedmann equation is a a 2 H2 0 \u2126\u039b,0 21 where \u2126\u039b,0 \u03c1\u039b,0 \u03c1c,0 8\u03c0G\u03c1\u039b,0 3H2 0 is the energy density of dark energy relative to the present day critical density. In this case it is easy to show that the resulting solution is a Universe that expands exponentially as a function of time a t a0 eH0\u21261 2 \u039b,0 t t0 . 22 We will return to this concept of exponential expansion when we discuss the in\ufb02ationary epoch. 3 Distance Measures in Cosmology 3.1 The Line of Sight Comoving Distance Previously we discussed the distinction between the comoving distance r and the proper distance rp. A small comoving distance \u03b4r between two nearby objects in the Universe is the distance between them which remains constant with epoch if the two objects are moving with the Hubble \ufb02ow. In other words, if \u03b4rp is the proper distance between them which 5 would be measured with rulers at the time te they are being observed, then the comoving distance is this \u03b4rp divided by the ratio of the scale factor of the Universe between then and now \u03b4r \u03b4rp a te 1 ze \u03b4rp. 23 The total line of sight comoving distance r from us to a distant object is computed by integrating the in\ufb01nitesimal \u03b4r contributions between nearby events along the radial ray from z 0 t t0 to the object. In other words to determine the line of sight comoving distance we integrate along the the null geodesic connecting us with the object, which given the equation for a null geodesic ds2 cdt2 a2 t dr2 0, implies dr cdt a t and hence dc dr t0 te cdt a t , 24 from which we can see that this is a sum of in\ufb01tesimal cdt proper distances divided by the scale factor a t at each epoch, making it a sum of in\ufb01tesimal comoving distances consistent with the discussion above. Exploiting the fact that dt a dt da da a da aa dz a a dz H z , 25 where we have used H a a and a 1 1 z . We can then write dc c z 0 dz H z dH z 0 dz E z , 26 where we have de\ufb01ned the Hubble distance dH cH 1 0 4.3 h 0.70 1 Gpc, 27 written the Hubble constant today as H0 70 h 0.70 km s 1 Mpc 1, 28 and used the fact that H z H0E z where E z \u2126m,0a 3 \u2126r,0a 4 \u2126v,0 \u2126k,0a 2 1 2 . 29 Note that the line of sight comoving distance is not directly observable. Nevertheless, in some sense it is the fundamental distance measure in cosmology since, as we will see below, all the other distance measures can be simply expressed in terms of it. 3.2 Angular Diameter Distance Suppose that we can observe some yardstick whose proper length\u2113is known at a cosmological distance. Imagine this yardstick to be aligned perpendicular to our line of sight as illustrated 6 Figure 2 An observer at the origin observes a yardstick of proper length \u2113 at a comoving distance r. Figure from Ryden. in Fig. 2, such that it has \u03c6 constant, subtends an angle \u03b4\u03b8 on the sky where \u03b4\u03b8 1, and that the light from this yardstick has a redshift of z corresponding to some cosmic time te. The angular diameter distance is de\ufb01ned by dA \u2113 \u03b4\u03b8, 30 in other words it is equal to the familiar proper distance to the yardstick in the small angle limit that would hold if the universe were static and Euclidean. To determine the relationship between dA and the comoving distance dc we derived above, recall that the metric tells us us how to compute proper distances, and that the proper distance between two points is equal to the length of the spatial geodesic between them with time \ufb01xed at some te and thus with the scale factor a te also \ufb01xed, in other words dt 0 ds2 a2 te dr2 S2 k r d\u21262 , 31 where d\u21262 d\u03b82 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62. Thus the distance between two ends of the yardstick in Fig. 2 for which \u03c6 const and r const ds a te Sk r d\u03b8. 32 Setting ds \u2113 and d\u03b8 \u03b4\u03b8 we deduce \u2113 a te Sk r \u03b4\u03b8 Sk r \u03b4\u03b8 1 z . 33 7 Using the de\ufb01nition of dA above we then have dA \u2113 \u03b4\u03b8 Sk r 1 z. 34 We will typically focus on the case k 0 for which Sk r r, such that the comoving distance to a distant object which emitted light at te corresponding to redshift z is just the line of sight comoving distance dc dr r that we calculated above, thus we \ufb01nd dA dc z 1 z. 35 Fig. 3 shows the angular diameter distance dA for the benchmark model and for two other spatially \ufb02at k 0 universes, one dominated by matter and one dominated by a cosmo logical constant. Note that it does not increase inde\ufb01nitely as z it turns over at z 1 and thereafter more distant objects actually appear larger in angular size.

For comparison, the dot dash line indicates a \ufb02at, lambda only universe, and the dotted line a \ufb02at, matter only universe. Figure from Ryden. 8 3.3 Luminosity Distance Figure 4 An observer at the origin observes a source of luminosity Lat comoving coordinate location r,\u03b8,\u03c6 at time te corresponding to redshift z. Figure from Ryden. Another important distance measure is the luminosity distance dL. Imagine that we have a source whose luminosity Lis known as depicted in Fig. 4. HereLis the bolometric luminosity which is the speci\ufb01c luminosity L\u03bb integrated over all wavelengths \u03bb. If we measure the \ufb02ux of this object f similarly integrated over all wavelengths on Earth, we de\ufb01ne the luminosity distance by dL L 4\u03c0f 1 2 . 36 Analogous to the angular diameter distance, this is what the proper distance to the source would be if the universe were static and Euclidean, since the dilution of light would follow the inverse square law f L 4\u03c0d2 . Let us derive what the luminosity distance dL should be by calculating what the \ufb02ux should be on Earth, which we can always do by working with physical quantities i.e. proper time, proper distance, observed energy . There are three e\ufb00ects we need to consider in an expanding universe 1. At the time time t0 that the light reaches earth, we want to calculate the proper area of a sphere drawn around the source and passing through Earth. Again, since we want a proper area, this can be determined from the metric, in other words for some solid angle d\u2126 at the source subtended by a di\ufb00erential area dA on Earth we have dA a2 t0 S2 k r d\u2126. 37 Noting that the scale factor is evaluated at z 0 t t0 which is a t0 1 and integrating over solid angle we obtain A 4\u03c0S2 k r . 38 9 2. Redshifting of the photons due to the expansion of the universe causes the energy of each photon from the source to decrease. If the a photon starts with energy Ee h\u03bde when the scale factor is a te , it arrives at Earth with energy E0 h\u03bd0 h\u03bdea te h\u03bde 1 z reduced by a factor of 1 z . 3. Time dilation implies that the time between the photon detections on Earth at t0 is longer than the time between photon emissions at t te. If two photons emitted in the same direction are separated by a time interval \u03b4te the proper distance between them will initially be c\u03b4te corresponding to a comoving distance c\u03b4te a te . By the time we detect these photons on Earth the proper distance between them will be c\u03b4tea t0 a te c\u03b4t0, so we see that \u03b4t0 1 z \u03b4te. Putting this all together we arrive at the correct formula for the observed \ufb02ux on Earth from our source of luminosity L at redshift z f L 4\u03c0S2 k R 1 z 2 , 39 which combined with the de\ufb01nition of luminosity distance in eqn. 36 gives dL Sk r 1 z , 40 from which we immediately see that dL 1 z 2dA. 41 For the case where space is \ufb02at recall that dA dc 1 z 42 and so dL 1 z dc. 43 Fig. 5 shows the luminosity distancedL as a function of redshift for the Benchmark Model and for two other \ufb02at universes, one dominated by matter and one dominated by a cosmological constant. 3.4 Lookback Time The lookback time tL to an object is the di\ufb00erence betweeen the age t0 of the universe now at observation and the age te of the universe at the time photons were emitted by some object. It is used to compare the properties of distant high redshift objects with evolutionary models and to quote an overall age of the universe. Recalling that a 1 1 z and that the expanstion rate a a H z H0E z , we have da a2 dz and thus dt dt dada da aH a dz 1 z H z , 44 10 Figure 5 Luminosity distance as a function of the observed redshift z, in units of the Hubble distance DH. The bold solid line gives the result for the Benchmark Model. For comparison, the dot dash line indicates a \ufb02at, lambda only universe, and the dotted line a \ufb02at, matter only universe. and hence tL t0 te t0 te dt tH z 0 dz 1 z E z , 45 where we have introduced the Hubble time tH H 1 0 13.97 h 0.70 1 Gyr 46 3.5 Comoving Volume The comoving volumeVC is the volume measure for which the number densities of non evolving objects locked into Hubble \ufb02ow are constant with redshift. It is the proper volume times three factors of the relative scale factor now to then, 1 z 3. According to eqn. 26 , 11 the derivative of comoving distance is d dz dc dH E z . 47 The angular diameter distance dA squared converts a solid angle d\u2126 into a proper area dAp, then to get a comoving area dAc requires that we divide by two factors of the scale factor or multiply by 1 z 2 dAc 1 z 2dAp d2 A 1 z 2d\u2126. 48 To get the di\ufb00erential comoving volume element dVc associated with a solid angle d\u2126 and redshift interval dz, we thus mupltiply d dz dc by dAc which gives dVc dH 1 z 2d2 A E z d\u2126dz, 49 or d2Vc dzd\u2126 dH 1 z 2d2 A E z 50 By integrating this expression over some redshift interval z1 to z2 and some solid angle 4 \u03c0 for the entire sky , the total comoving volume can be computed. The comoving volume element and its integral are both used frequently in predicting number counts or luminosity densities of extragalactic objects. 12",

Recall that we derived the scalings T 1010 K kBT 1M e V 107 gc m 3 1 4 1 z 1010 t 1s 1 2 , 1 and thus the temperature is decreasing continuously as a function of time. We derived this scaling via a simple application of thermodynamics to a small patch of the homogeneous and isotropic Universe. In the next few lectures we will show that this thermal history combined with statistical mechanics, particle, nuclear, and atomic physics, allows a detailed prediction of the matter content of the universe at each epoch. 1 General Overview Previously we used the \ufb01rst law of thermodyanmics dQ TdS dE PdV, 2 and made the assumption that the expansion is adiabaticdQ TdS 0t od e r i v et h e\ufb02 u i d equation 3 a a p 0 . 3 In deriving the \ufb02uid equation we have made a very strong assumption the universe is comprised of perfect \ufb02uids which evolve according to a sequence of adiabatic reversible transformations dS 0, i.e. at each instant the universe is in an equilibrium state. Although the treatment of the contents of the universe as perfect \ufb02uids allowed us to derive the basic equations governing the expansion of the universe, it is not su cient for detailed study of the behavior and interactions of realistic particles at high temperature. For this we need to use statistical mechanics to describe the distribution functions of the Universe s constituent particles, and we need to think very carefully about what it means to be in thermal equilibrium. It could be that some particles are in equlibrium with each other, whereas others are not. For example previously we discussed that the Universe is currently permeated with a cosmic background of relativistic neutrinos as well as the cosmic microwave background. Whereas the CMB is a black body radiation \ufb01eld atT0 2 .73 K, the cosmic neutrino background has an equilibrium distribution with a di erent lower temperatureT ,0 1 .95 K. The di erence in these temperatures results from the neutrinos dropping out of equilibrium with the photons around one second after the Big Bang. We will discuss this in more detail later, and actually derive this temperature di erence. As we will see the most general non equilibrium description of the coupled distributions of particle species comes from solving the Boltzman equation. In this context, thermal 1 equilibrium dS 0a r i s e sa s s u m i n ge i t h e rn oi n t e r a c t i o n sa m o n gp a r t i c l e s e . g . a d i a b a t i c expansion , or by assuming a very high rate of interactions such that thermal equilbrium between di erent species can be achieved. The latter scenario is the key to undersatnding the thermal history of the universe. Speci\ufb01cally we will compare therate of interactions t ot h erate of expansionH. When H,t h e nt h et i m es c a l eo fp a r t i c l ei n t e r a c t i o n s is much smaller than the characteristic expansion time scale tc 1 tH 1 H , 4 then thermal equilibrium will be reached before the e ect of the expansion cooling becomes relevant. Particles interact so frequently that they do not care about the cosmological expansion any change in their energy density is rapidly shared among other particles via these rapid interactions maintaining thermal equilibrium. For a given particle species the interaction rate is de\ufb01ned by n vrel vrel mfp , 5 where n is the number density of projectile particles,vrel is the relative velocity between projectiles and targets, and is the interaction cross section, and the last equality used the de\ufb01nition of the mean free path mfp 1 n . Thus the condition H can be thought of equivalently as saying that the particle mean free path mfp vtH 6 is much shorter than the distance it can travel in the Hubble timetH,o ri ft h ep a r t i c l ei s relativistic that the mean free path is much shorter than the Hubble distancedH c H. Note that is di erent for di erent fundamental interactions and for di erent particle species and masses. Therefore, the above condition in eqn. 4 is valid for all the known and perhaps unknown particles in the very early universe but, as the universe expands, it is eventually broken at di erent times for di erent species. This is the essence of thethermal history of the universe. At the very beginning we are talking about tiny fractions of seconds after the Big Bang all the particles were in thermal equilibrium in a primordial soup known as theprimordial plasma,w h i c hi so f t e na l s or e f e r r e dt oa st h eprimordial radiation bath. When for a species, the condition H is reached, it decouples from the primordial plasma. If it does this by breaking the chemical equilibrium of some reaction for example pair production e e , then this reaction is said tofreeze out and the products attain some \ufb01xed relic abundance.1 The fundamental interactions which characterize the aforementioned processes compel some particles to react and transform into others and vice versa. When H these reactions take place with equal probability in both directions, hence the symbol, but when H eventually one direction is preferred over the other. This is the characteristic of irreversibility 1It attains a \ufb01xed abundance if it is a stable particle, of course. If not it disappears. 2 which causes equilibrium thermodynamics to fail, and thus demands the use of the Boltzmann equation. For example, we shall use the Boltzmann equation to calculate the relic abundance of CDM, quantify the recombination of protons and electrons into neutral hydrogen atoms, and analyze the formation of light elements duringBig Bang Nucleosynthesis. 2 Brief Summary of Thermal History In what follows we give a brief overview of some of the most important events that took place in the early thermal history of the Universe. Planck scale, in\ufb02ation, and Grand Uni\ufb01ed TheoryIn principle, ast !1 a t ! 0, but there comes a point at which this extrapolation of General Relativity, which is not a quantum theory of gravity, must break down. This is when the thermal energy of typical particles is such that their de Brogile wavelength is smaller than their Schwarzschild radius quantum black holes clearly cause di culties with the usual concept of background space time. Equating 2 mc w i t h2Gm c2 yields a characteristic mass for quantum gravity known as thePlanck mass. This mass, and the corresponding length Pl mPlc , and time Pl c form the sytem ofPlanck units mPl r c G 1019 GeV 7 Pl r G c3 10 35 m 8 tPl r G c5 10 43 s 9 The Planck time thus sets the origin of time for the classical phase of the Big Bang. Another commonly used Planck mass unit is MPl r c 8 G 2 .4 1018 GeV, 10 where a factor of 8 is introduced in the square root. The reason for this is that at early times when the curvature term a 2 in the Friedmann equation is negligibly small compared to the steepera dependence of the components of , one can then write the Friedmann equation as H2 3M2 Pl , 11 in particle physics units where 1 . In\ufb02ation is another very important piece of the current description of the primordial universe. We shall dedicate a lecture to it later on. For now, it is su cient to say that it occurs at an energy scale of the order 1016 GeV, which is the same scale as the Grand Uni\ufb01ed Theory GUT , i.e. models in which electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions are uni\ufb01ed. Baryogenesis and LeptogenesisRelativistic quantum \ufb01eld theory requires the existence of anti particles, which poses a slight puzzle. Particles and anti particles annihilate through 3 processes such as e e . 12 If initally the universe was \ufb01lled with equal amounts of matter and anti matter then we expect these annihilations to lead to a universe dominated by radiation. Basically, once the universe cools down below the mass energy of some baryon or lepton,kBT . mc2,p a i r production from the primordial plasma will eventually become energetically unfavorable and the reaction will no longer proceed to the left to produce particles and anti particles. Instead all the matter and anti matter will annihilate away leaving a universe \ufb01lled with radiation. However, we do observe an overabundance of matter mostly baryons over anti matter in the universe today. In order for this to be the case there needs to be some primordial matter antimatter asymmetry in the inital conditions. In other words, baryogenesis is the creation, via some as of yet unclear mechanism, of an overall positive baryon number. In order to maintain the neutrality of the universe, we thus also need Leptogenesis, i.e. a mechanism which produces a non vanishing lepton number in the form of an excess of electrons over positrons. Although many ideas for baryogenesis exist, none is singled out by experimental tests. We will not have much to say about baryogenesis in this course. Electroweak phase transitionAt a thermal energy of about 100 GeV, which corresponds to 10 12 seconds after the Big Bang, the electromagnetic and weak forces start to behave distinctly. This leads to a drastic change in the strength of the weak interaction which results in a phase transition. QCD phase transitionBelow 150 MeV quarks pass from their asymptotic freedom and bound states form from two mesons or three baryons of them. The above energy corre sponds roughly to 20\u00b5sa f t e rt h eB i gB a n g . Dark matter freeze outSince dark matter is very weakly interacting with ordinary matter we expect it to decouple relatively early on. We will study the example of WIMPs weakly interacting massive particles that freeze out around 10 100 GeV. We will show that choosing natural values for the mass of the dark matter particles and their interaction cross section with ordinary matter reproduces the observed relic dark matter density surprisingly well. Neutrino decouplingAt T 1010 K corresponding to an energy around 1 MeV, or around 1 s after the Big Bang a host of interactions between neutrinos anti neutrinos, leptons elec trons positrons and baryons protons and neutrons become ine ecient and neutrinos drop out of thermal equilibrium with the primordial plasma. After this neutrinos decouple and simply redshift away their energy until the present epoch, but their contribution to the total radiation energy density of the universe is not negligible. It thus alters when matter radiation equality takes place, and as a result the strength of anisotropies in the CMB. Electron positron annihilationThe interaction e e , 13 will remain in thermal equilibrium provided the energykBT of the primordial plasma is larger than the mass of electrons and positronsmec2 511 keV. When the temperature of the thermal bath drops below this value pair production is no longer possible and annihilation 4 takes over. The entropy and energy from these electron positron pairs is then transferred to the photon bath, but since the neutrinos already decoupled earlier, this explains the small temperature di erence between the nutrinos and the CMB today, which we will derive explicitly. Thanks to leptogenesis, positrons disappear and only electrons are left. Big Bang Nucleosynthesis BBN At t af e wm i n u t e s T 109 K , nucleosynthesis starts, synthesizing protons and neutrons to produce D, He and a few other elements. Since the temperature is still too high for the formation of neutral atoms, all these elements are highly ionized. Recombination At T 4000 K t 2 105 yr roughly 50 of the baryonic matter is in the form of neutral atoms. This point in time is often called the time ofrecombination. Because of the resulting drop in the number density of free electrons, the universe suddenly becomes transparent to photons which is known asdecoupling.T h e s e p h o t o n s a r e o b s e r v e d today as the cosmic microwave background. From this point on, photons, neutrinos, H, He and other atoms all expand freely with the Universe. Just before this time, the energy density in relativistic particles became smaller than that in the rest mass of non relativistic matter, and the Universe enters the matter dominated epoch. 3 Equilibrium Thermodynamics 3.1 A Note on Units We will always keep units throughout all of our calculations. But as the study of the thermal history of the universe is concerned with high energy physics, you will often see results in other references in the natural unit system in which the speed of lightc,B o l t z m a n n s constant kB,a n dP l a n c k sc o n s t a n t hP 2 are all set to 1. In cgs units c c m s 1, g c m2 s 1,a n d kB g c m2 s 2 K 1.T h e r e f o r e , m a k i n g t h e s e c o n s t a n t s d i m e n s i o n l e s s implies that energy mass temperature time 1 l e n g t h 1, 14 and all physical quantities can be expressed in one unit, which is usually energy. Another way to state this is that in SI units the fundamental units are mass, length, and time whereas in natural units the fundamental units are velocity, action energy time , and energy. Since we have set the velocity unitc 1a n dt h ea c t i o nu n i t 1 ,t h eo n l y remaining thing with dimensions is energy. The unit of choice for energy is the electron volt , where the energy scales are eV in atomic physics, MeV in nuclear physics, and GeV in particle physics. Whenever needed, the missing powers ofc, kB,a n d in equations can be reinserted straightforwardly from simple dimensional analysis. Appendix C.1 of Baumann s book has a nice explanation of natural units and how to convert into SI units. One useful thing to note is that number densities in these natural units will typically be expressed as n T3 or n mT 3 2, 15 5 which in normal units become n kBT c 3 or n mc2kBT 2c2 3 2 mkBT 2 3 2 . 16 From these the units of energy density or pressure then just have an extra factor of energy multiplied in, and it should be obvious which constant is needed to get the correct units. 3.2 Distribution Functions Figure 1 Phase space of position and momentum in one dimension. Volume of each cell is 2 , the smallest region into which a particle can be con\ufb01ned because of Heisenberg s uncertainty principle. Shaded region has in\ufb01nitesmal volumedxdp which covers nine cells. To count the appropriate number of cells, therefore, the phase space integral must be R dxdp 2 As we discussed, through most of the early universe, reactions proceeded rapidly enough to keep particles in equilibrium, such that di erent species share a common temperature. We will often want to express the number density, energy density, pressure, etc. in terms of this temperature. For this reason, and many others which will emerge shortly, it is convenient to introduce the occupation number, ordistribution function f of a species. This distribution function counts the number of particles in a given region in phase space2 2Note that here we are working in proper coordinates, i.e.x is a proper position coordinate, and byp 6 around a positionx and momentump. Then if we want to determine the energy of a species we would construct the weighted sum of the energy of each state over all of the phase space elements Pf x, p E p . How many phase space elements are there in a region of volume dx3dp3? By Heisenberg s uncertainty principle, no particle can be localized into a region of phase space smaller than 2 3, so this is the size of a fundamental element. Therefore, the number of phase space elements indx3dp3 is dx3dp3 2 3 see Fig. 1 . Homogeneity implies that this distribution function should be independent of positionx,a n di s o t r o p yr e q u i r e st h a tf f p d e p e n d s only on the magnitude of the momentump p .W e c a n t h u s i n t e g r a t e o u t t h e s p a t i a l p a r t over the volume to obtain that the density in phase space is the density of states times the distribution function g 2 3 f p , 17 where g is a degeneracy factor which counts internal degrees of freedom e.g. spin . The number densityof particles in real space is found by integrating eqn. 17 over momentum n g 2 3 Z d3pf p . 18 To obtain the energy density of the gas particles we have to weight each momentum by its energy. To a very good approximation the particles in the early universe were weakly interacting. This allows us to ignore the interaction energies between the particles and simply write that the energy of a particle of massm and momentump simply as E p p m2c4 p2c2. 19 This then implies that the energy density is g 2 3 Z d3pf p E p . 20 and the pressure is P g 2 3 Z d3pf p p2c2 3E p , 21 where the last equation for the pressureP comes from a generalization of the standard kinetic theory derivation of the pressure of an ideal gas to the case of a relativistic gas see Mukhanov Physical Foundations of Cosmology 3.3.2 for a derviation . It is immediately clear that if the particles are relativisticE2 p2c2 see eqn. 19 that eqn. 21 then implies P 3o rw 1 3a sw ea r g u e dp r e v i o u s l yi st h ec a s ef o rr a d i a t i o n . here we mean the not the comoving momentum but rather the proper momentum which redshifts away with the expansion. 7 3.3 Equilibrium Distribution Functions To properly describe the physical processes in an expanding universe including departures from equilibrium, we need, strictly speaking, a full kinetic theory which we will come to later. Fortunately, there are many situations in the early universe when the particles are in a state of local thermodynamic equilibrium LTE with each other. We qualify this equilibrium with the word local to stress that the Universe cannot be treated as a typical thermodynamic system in equilibrium with an in\ufb01nite thermal bath at some given temperature it is a dynamically evolving nonequilibrium system. More concretely, we know that the temperature of the thermal bath changes as the universe expands. Therefore, by local equilibrium we simply mean that matter has maximal possible entropy. In practice entropy will be maximized for a species when H as we discussed already. We will come to an even clearer de\ufb01nition of what is meant by LTE shortly. It can be shown that for a system of particles constrained to have a \ufb01xed amount of total energy E and number of particlesN the entropy is maximized, and thus the system is in LTE, when its particles have the following distribution function f p 1 e E p \u00b5 kBT 1, 22 where the sign is for fermions electrons, or baryons, i.e. protons and neutrons which obey Fermi Dirac statistics and the for bosons photons which obey Bose Einstein statistics.

Speci\ufb01cally, it is de\ufb01ned as the derivative of the entropy with respect to the number of particlesN,a t\ufb01 x e de n e r g ya n d\ufb01 x e dv o l u m e ,m u l t i p l i e db yt h et e m p e r a t u r e \u00b5 T S N E,V . 24 Taking into account the possibility of changing particle number, the \ufb01rst law of thermody namics becomes dQ TdS dE PdV \u00b5dN, 25 where \u00b5dN is sometimes called thechemical work. 8 Now let us consider some reaction that is capable of changing members of one species into members of another species. We will denote this reaction in the following form 1A1 2A2 lAl X j jAj 0 . 26 The coe cients l are known as the stoichiometric factors, and they simply specify how the numbers of the di erent species are related. For example, consider the reaction 2H2 O 2 2H2O. 27 In this caseA1 H 2, A2 O 2, A3 H 2O, 1 2 , 2 1 ,a n d 3 2. The meaning of this is that every forward reaction destroys 2 H2 molecules and 1 O2 molecule, and produces 2H 2Om o l e c u l e s . In LTE we know thatdS 0w h i c ht h e ni m p l i e s dS X i S Ni dNi X i \u00b5i Ti dNi X i \u00b5i T dNi 0 ! X i \u00b5idNi 0 , 28 where the last equality used the fact that the temperatures must all be the same in equi librium Ti T.I f t h i s c o n d i t i o nP i \u00b5idNi 0w e r en o ts a t i s \ufb01 e dt h e nt h ep a r t i c l e sc o u l d convert into each other to increase the entropy further violating our assumption dS 0 o f LTE. But given the de\ufb01nition of chemical potential, a single forward reaction results in the follow ing change in the entropy X i i \u00b5i Ti , 29 and the negative of this for a backward reaction. Thus we can identify dNi i.I n equilibrium whereT Ti the condition thatdS 0t h u si m p l i e si nt e r m so ft h es t o c h i o m e t r i c factors X i i\u00b5i 0 , 30 The equation above de\ufb01nes what we will refer to aschemical equilibrium. If the number of particles is not constrained then the chemical potential is zero. For example for black body radiation which is an equilibrium con\ufb01gruation, the number of photons in the system is not conserved. A photon may collide with an electron in the wall of the cavity, exciting it to a higher energy state, removing a photon from the photon gas. This electron may drop back to its lower level in a series of steps, each one of which releases an individual photon back into the photon gas. Although the sum of the photon energies of the emitted photons are the same as the absorbed photon, the number of emitted photons will vary. Another simple example of photon non conservation is double Compton scattering e e which happens in equilibrium at high temperatures. The only way that 9 these changes in photon number can maintaindS 0i si f S N 0 ,i m p l y i n g \u00b5 0 . 31 This implies that if the chemical potential of a particleX is \u00b5X,t h e nt h ec h e m i c a lp o t e n t i a l of the corresponding anti particle X is \u00b5 X \u00b5X. 32 To see this, just consider particle antiparticle annihilation,X X . For the purposes of computing the equilibrium distribution functions we will be able to ignore the chemical potentials because it can be shown that they are negligibly small compared to kBT.Y o u w i l l s h o w t h a t t h i s i s t h e c a s e i n t h e h o m e w o r k .B u t f o r s i t u a t i o n s w h e r e w e a r e trying to study chemical equilibrium, we will of course not be able to neglect them. Finally, we can now make the distinction betweenkinetic equilibrium and chemical equilibrium.C o n s i d e rar e a c t i o nf o rw h i c h H of the type A B C D, 33 or in terms of chemical potentials, \u00b5A \u00b5B \u00b5C \u00b5D, 34 which we de\ufb01ne aschemical equilibrium. On the other hand, when H refers to a reaction such as scattering A B A B, 35 this is referred to askinetic equilibrium. Mathematically kinetic equilibrium implies that the distribution functions for both species A and B are of the form given in eqn. 22 at the same temperature T. In general, it is possible for a species to break chemical equilibrium and still remain in kinetic equilibrium with the rest of the cosmic plasma through scattering processes. We will thus use LTE to refer to a situation where the particles under consideration are in kinetic or chemical equilibrium or both . In practical terms LTE will mean the particles under consideration share a common equilibrium temperature Ti T, and often this temperature T will be identi\ufb01ed with the photon temperatureT which we will refer to as the temperature of the universe . 3.5 Expressions for n, , andP Given the distribution function, we can then calculate the number densityn,e n e r g yd e n s i t y and pressure P. In what follows we will work out two important special cases, namely relativistic and non relativistic particles. 10 3.5.1 Relativistic Species mc2 kBT, \u00b5 kBT In the relativistic limit, we can write the energy asE pc.G o i n g t h r o u g h t h e m a t h o n e \ufb01nds for the number density n g kBT 3 3 2 3c3 1b o s o n s 3 4 fermions , 36 energy density g kBT 4 2 30 3c3 1b o s o n s 7 8 fermions , 37 and pressure P 3 . 38 There are several points here that are worth noting. First, we have now derived from statistical mechanics the equation of state for radiation, and indeed we \ufb01nd thatw P 1 3. Second, plugging in numbers for photons which are bosons withg 2w ea r i v ea t the Stefan Boltzmann relation aRT4 4 SBT4 c SB k4 B 2 60 3c2 5 .6704 10 8Js 1m 2K 4. 39 where the Stefan Boltzmann constant is de\ufb01ned above. 3.5.2 Non Relativistic Species mc2 kBT, \u00b5 kBT In the limitmc2 kBT and \u00b5 kBT we can use the fact thatv2 c2 kBT mc2 1 i.e. v2 kBT m is the rms velocity of an ideal gas , and hencep2 m2c2 v2 c2 1. Then we can expand the energy to \ufb01rst order inp2 m2c 2 to obtain E p m2c4 p2c2 mc2 p2 2m. 40 In the non relativistic limit, the equilibrium distribution functionf p a l s oa s s u m e st h e Maxwell Boltzmann form see eqn. 23 , sincemc2 kBT implies kBT E \u00b5.C o m b i n i n g these two approximations, eqn. 18 for the particle number density integrates to n g mkBT 2 2 3 2 e mc2 kBT . 41 So we \ufb01nd that in the non relativistic limit massive particles are exponentially rare at tem peratures much smaller than their rest mass energykBT mc2.I n a d d i t i o n , p l u g g i n g eqn. 40 into eqn. 20 gives n mc2 3 2kBT nmc2. 42 11 Analogously for the pressure P,w o r k i n gt o\ufb01 r s to r d e ri np2 m2c2 i ne q n . 2 1 m e a n s expanding E p p m2c4 p2c2 mc2 to zeroth order, it then immediately follows that P nkBT P 0 , 43 or w P 0 for matter. Which is the full derivation of what we concluded before, that non relativistic matter behaves like a dust \ufb02uid. 3.6 Interpretation By comparing the relativistic limit kBT mc2 a n dt h en o n r e l a t i v i s t i cl i m i t kBT mc2 , we see that the number density, energy density, and pressure of a particle species fall exponentially are Boltzmann suppressed as the temperature drops below the mass of the particle. This re\ufb02ects the coupling to the photon \ufb02uid in the primordial plasma at the equilibrium temperature. When kBT mc2 the photons have su cient energy to create a thermal background number density of particle antiparticle pairs. However, when kBT mc2 only an exponential tail of the photon distribution function has su cient energy for pair creation, causing a similar suppression of their number density. This exponential suppression has several important consequences. First it implies that non relativistic particles either become exponentially rare, or that their numbers drop below the density where they interact su ciently often to stay in equilibrium recall tht n v a n d hence they go out of equilibrium ordecouple and the interactions are said tofreeze out. Both cases are of interest. For example, electrons and positrons interact very strongly via the Coulomb force and so maintain equilibrium until there are almost no positrons left atkBT mec2 0.5M e V t h e y all annihilate with electrons . Other particles that interact weakly, likeweakly interacting massive particlesor WIMPs,w h i c ha r ead a r km a t t e rc a n d i d a t e ,w o u l ds i m p l yr a p i d l y drop out of equilibrium and hencefreeze out,p o s s i b l yg i v i n gr i s et oas i g n i \ufb01 c a n tr e l i c abundance of matter indeed this is why they are a dark matter candidate, as we will discuss . Finally, we observe that particles following these equilibrium distributionscan only contribute signi\ufb01cantly to the energy density and pressure when they are relativistic.Thus if we have a collection of relativistic species, each of them having an equilbirium at di erent temperatures Ti,w ec a nw r i t et h et o t a le n e r g yd e n s i t y , R,a sas u mo v e ra l lt h ec o n t r i b u t i o n s R X i i 2 30 3c3 g? T kBT 4, 44 where we have introducedg?,t h ee ective number of degrees of freedom,g i v e nb y g? T X bosons gi Ti T 4 7 8 X fermions gi Ti T 4 , 45 where T is equilibrium temperature of the photon bath. Note that this only requires the dif 12 ferent components to haveequilibrium distributions which are what determine the densities and pressures at temperaturesTi t h e c o m p o n e n t s d o n t a c t u a l l y n e e d t o m a i n t a i n s t r o n g self interactions such that they are in equilibrium with each other in which case one would have Ti T . As long as an equilibrium distribution is maintained after they go out of thermal equilibrium as we will discuss next , and that they are relativistic, they contribute signi\ufb01cantly to the energy density in the early radiation dominated phase of the universe. As the temperature decreases, the e ective number of degrees of freedom in radiation will decrease, as massive particles start behaving non relativistically whenkBT drops below their rest mass energy. In Fig. 2 we show a numerical calculation of the full evolution ofg?,w h i c h is based on the properties of particles in the standard model, which are listed in Table 3. We brie\ufb02y discuss a few regimes of interest kBT 1M e V t h eo n l yr e l a t i v i s t i cp a r t i c l e sw o u l db et h e3n e u t r i n os p e c i e sa n dt h e corresponding anti neutrinos3 fermions, 1 degree of freedom each and the photons boson, 2 polarization states . Neutrinos at these energies are decoupled from the thermal bath see 4 , but maintain a thermal distribution at a slightly lower temper ature than the photons, withT 4 11 1 3T we will derive this in detail shortly . Therefore g? 2 z photons neutrinos anti neutrinos z 7 8 3 3 4 11 4 3 3.36 . 46 1M e V T 100 MeV Electrons and positrons have a mass of about 0.5M e V , and so they are now also relativistic.

Anti neutrinos exist in the latter scenario, whereas in the former scenario neutrinos are their own anti particle like photons. See the Aside on neutrinos in 3.1.2 of Baumann s book for more details. Since the total number of degrees of freedom needs to be the same in both of these scenarios to satisfy Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, we will just refer to the anti neutrino i.e. Dirac mass case for concreteness. 4If there are additional new particles,g? could increase further. 13 Figure 2 The full evolution of the e ective degrees of freedomg? with temperature for the standard model. The masses on the top axes indicate a few speci\ufb01c masses of particles in the standard model at temperatures higher than the mass they are approximately in equilibrium, below the mass they annihilate. The QCD phase transition is more complicated, and the evolution cannot be evaluated analytically in that regime at higher temperatures the evolution also has non trivial corrections and may not asymptote to the full thermal result of 106.75 . The value today,g? 3 .38, is the analytic result 3.36 plus a small correction because neutrino decoupling ande e annihilation overlap slightly, slightly heating the neutrinos to a higher temperature than 4 11 T . The valueg? 86.25 is what s you d expect for everything exceptW ,W ,Z 0, Higgs which all have m mW and the top quark being in equilibrium, which does not accurately match the plateau because of non trivial QCD and electroweak e ects. Figure from Antony Lewis notes. 3.7 Distribution of Decoupled Species An Example the CMB We can now apply what we have learned so far to the CMB. First consider the following question why is the CMB observed to be a perfect black body radiation \ufb01eld today? Recall that a black body radiation \ufb01eld is what results when radiation and matter are in thermal equilibrium with each other. At present, the radiation and matter in the universe are wildly out of equilbrium with each other. Indeed, most of the baryons are in the form of ionized gas in the IGM at temperatureT 104 but the CMB is atT 2 .73 K. So what gives, why should the CMB be a perfect black body today? The answer of course is that the radiation and matter were in thermal equilibrium in the past due to Thompson scattering of photons with electrons and at this time the radiation \ufb01eld was a black body. This equilibrium was maintained until some timetf , which we will refer to as the time of ofphoton decouplingwhich is closely related to but not exactly the same as last scattering.T h e p h o t o n s d e c o u p l e f r o m t h e m a t t e r b e c a u s e d u r i n grecombination the formation of the \ufb01rst atoms rapidly decreases the electron density causing the opacity to suddenly drop. After this timetf ,t h ec o n d i t i o n H is violated where is the Thompson scattering rate , the universe becomes transparent to Thompson scattering, and the photons decouple from the matter. The CMB is thus a relic radiation \ufb01eld, and the black body that is frozen in is a vestige of the timest t f when it was in thermal equilibrium. Let s now 14 Figure 3 The standard model particles, with their mass, spin and degeneraciesgs. Table from Baumann. understand how this works mathematically using what we have learned. Recalling our expression for the number density in terms of the distribution function in eqn. 18 , at some timet t f when the radiation is in thermal equilibrium the number 15 density of photons is n g 2 3 Z f p d3p g 2 2 3 Z 1 0 p2dp eE T 1 Z 1 0 8 c3 2d eh kBT 1, 48 where in the last equality we usedE pc h , p h c 2 c,a n dg 2f o rp h o t o n s . We can rewrite this as n Z nT d nT 8 c3 2 eh kBT 1, 49 where nT i st h ep h o t o nf r e q u e n c yd i s t r i b u t i o nf u n c t i o n ,i . e . t h en u m b e ro fp h o t o n s between and d at times t t f and temperature T when LTE holds hence the subscript T . What happens at later timest t f ?T h e p h o t o n s n o w t r a v e l f r e e l y t h r o u g h t h e u n i v e r s e without scattering o of electrons. We can write that their distribution functionn , t o b e y s n , t d a tf a t 3 n 0,t f d 0, 50 which simply expresses conservation of the number of photons after decoupling. Hence the factors a tf a t 3,w h i c ha r i s ef r o mt h ed i l u t i o no fp h o t o n sd u et oc o s m i ce x p a n s i o n . W e can relate 0 at t tf to at time t by noting that aftertf photons simply redshift away their energy, such that 0a tf a t ! 0 a t a tf . So we \ufb01nd n , t d a tf a t 3 n a t a tf ,t f d a t a tf . 51 We thus see that the ratio of scale factorsa t a tf a l lc a n c e le x c e p ti nt h ee x p o n e n t i a l ,s o that the number density at timet is given by n , t d 8 c3 2d eh kBT t 1 T t T tf a tf a t . 52 Thus the distribution of photon energies retains the black body form even afer the photons went out of equilbrium with matter, but with a temperature that decreases with time as T a 1. In general, if some particle speciesi dropped out of thermal equilibrium with decoupled from the hot plasma at some timetf , its temperature at that time is approximately equal to the photon temperature at that timeTf T tf , where hot plasma refers now to all relativistic species including photons which we indicate asT or sometimes justT . After decoupling, the mean interaction rate of the particle drops below the expansion rateH, and the particle moves on a geodesic. As we have seen the momentum of a particle scales as p a 1 due to Hubble drag, which is valid for both relativistcic and non relativistic species. Since the relative momenta are conserved as we ve just seen for the example of the CMB, 16 the actual distribution function att t f can be written as f p, t f p a t a tf ,t f . 53 In other words, the form of the distribution function is frozen in the moment the particles decouple from the hot plasma, and the only thing that evolves with time is the temperature of that distributionTi. If a species is still relativistic after decoupling such thatE pc,t h e nw eh a v e f p, t g 2 3 exp pc kBTi 1 1 Ti t Tf a tf a t . 54 Thus, as we ve just seen for the CMB, the distribution of a decoupled, relativistic species is self similar to that of a relativistic species in thermal equilibrium, but with a temperature Ti t . Note that this does not necessarily equal to the temperature of the hot plasma at this later timet,a sw es h a l ls e ei nam o m e n t . If the species is already non relativistic when it decouples, its energy is given byE mc2 p2 2m,a n ds i n c ekBT mc2 we can ignore the 1t e r ms ot h a tt h ed i s t r i b u t i o nf u n c t i o ni s Maxwell Boltzmann f p e E p kBT . 55 where we have assumed \u00b5 kBT 1 or f p, t g 2 3 exp mc2 kBTf exp p2 2mkBTi , 56 which is the Maxwell Boltzmann distribution. Note however that because of the di erentp2 dependence in the exponential, and thep a 1 dependence, this implies that the tempera ture of this decoupled distribution scales di erently as Ti Tf a tf a t 2 . 57 We derived this scaling for temperature previously from kinetic theory by noting thatkBT mhv2i and v a 1.I ti si n t u i t i v et h a tt h i sh o l d sf o rt h et e m p e r a t u r eo fd e c o u p l e dp a r t i c l e s as well since they are described by a frozen in Maxwell Boltzmann distribution, which is the origin of kinetic theory.

As we will see, in cosmology entropy is more informative than energy. It is easy to show that the entropy is conserved in LTE, as you showed on the homework. According to the second law of thermodynamics, the total entropy of the universe only increases or stays constant. Since there are far more photons than baryons in the universe, the entropy of the universe is dominated by the entropy of the photon bath at least as long as the universe is su ciently uniform . Any entropy production from irreversible processes is therefore totally insigni\ufb01cant relative to the total entropy. To a good approximation, we can therefore treat the expansion of the universe as adiabatic, so that the total entropy of the universe stays constant even if di erent particles species have dropped out of equilibrium at various times. The entropy density is de\ufb01ned by s S V , 59 and you demonstrated in the homework that this is a conserved quantity, i.e. sa3 c o n s t a n t. 60 We brie\ufb02y review how this is derived. The \ufb01rst lawof thermodynamcs can be written dS V,T 1 T dU PdV 1 T d T V P T dV . 61 In general the di erential ofS can be written dS V,T S V dV S T dT. 62 Reading o the partial derivatives by comparing eqns. 61 and 62 , and applying the intergrability condition 2S V T 2S T V , 63 yields dP dT T P T T . 64 Now rewriting the \ufb01rst law as dS 1 T dV Vd PdV 1 T dV Vd PdV Vd P Vd P 1 T d P V V T2 P dT d P V T , 65 18 where the second line used eqn. 64 . Since the entropy must be stationary in LTE,dS 0 , this then implies S P V T c o n s t a n t. 66 Since the total entropy should be an extensive quantityS V , we can choose this constant to be zero. Thus the entropy density iss S V s P T . 67 Now what about the time evolution ofs.W e l l w e k n o w t h a t i n L T E t h e e n t r o p y i s s t a t i o n a r y dS 0 . T h u si fS sV then dS da ds daV sdV da 0 1 s ds da 1 V dV da s a 3 or sa3 const 68 where in the last equality we used thatV a3. For a relativistic speciesi in LTE we have seen see eqn. 37 and eqn. 38 that only relativistic particles contribute signi\ufb01cantly to the energy density and pressure and that i 2 30 3c3 gi kBTi 4 Pi i 3 , 69 which implies that si 2 2 45 3c3 gi kBTi 3 70 or summing over all speciesi s X i si X i 2 2 45 3c3 gi kBTi 3 2 2 45 3c3 g?S T kBT 3, 71 where T is the photon bath temperature, and we have de\ufb01ned theefective number of degrees of freedom in entropy, g?S T X bosons gi Ti T 3 7 8 X fermions gi Ti T 3 . 72 Notice that g?S is equal to g? in eqn. 45 only when all the relativistic species are in equilibrium at the same temperature. From now on we will simly take T T as the temperature of the universe. Conservation of entropy has several important consequences, which we know brie\ufb02y discuss. Scaling ofT with scale factora With our de\ufb01nition ofg?S conservation of entropy can be written g?S T T3a3 c o n s t T g 1 3 ?S T a 1, 73 19 which follows simply fromsa3 c o n s t c o n s e r v a t i o no fe n t r o p y a n dt h ed e \ufb01 n i t i o no f g?S T a b o v e . A tt e m p e r a t u r e sa w a yf r o mp a r t i c l em a s st h r e s h o l d st h r e s h o l d sg?S T is approximately constant and thusT a 1 as we expect for radiation. The factor of g 1 3 ?S T accounts for the fact that whenever a particle species becomes non relativistic freezes out and disappears, its entropy is transferred to the other relativistic species still present in the thermal plasma, causingT to thus descrease slightly less slowly than a 1 sometimes this is called heating . We will see an example of this in the next section. Entropy is a useful reference quantity for number densities Becase s a 3, the number of particles in a comoving volume is therefore proportional to the number density ni divided by the total entropy density Ni ni s . 74 If particles are neither produced nor destroyed, thenni a 3,a n dNi is constant. This is very useful when we describe decoupled relics which are frozen in. The point is that because the number of degrees of freedomg? could be changing throughout the radiation dominated phase see Fig. 2 the expansion history, the temperature evolution, and the total number of photons are not simple functions ofa or time, and not that easy to relate to the number of CMB photons today which we know well . The equation above says thatNi is the number of particles per unit total entropy, and if particles are conserved say after decoupling since total entropy is conserved, it is then trivial to determine the number density of relics at timet t0,b ys i m p l y multiplying the present day value of the entropy densitys0 by Ni. Another example is the total baryon number. I can computenB,0 s0 today and this has to be equal to the total baryon number just after the epoch of baryogenesisnB s nb n b s since baryons don t decay away . Relativistic hot relics are comparable in number to CMB photons Finally, we saw earlier eqn. 58 that for any decoupled species we can write, n t a tf a t 3 neq tf . 75 If the species is relativistic when it decouples its number density is, from eqn. 36 , n g kBT 3 3 2 3c3 1b o s o n s 3 4 fermions . 76 For the moment absorb the factor of 1 or 3 4i n t os o m ege where ge g for bosons and ge 3 4 g for fermions, whereg is here the degeneracy factor of the decoupled species. Then we can compare the number density of a relativistically decoupled species 20 to that of the CMB photonsnCMB at some later timet t f n t nCMB t neq tf nCMB t a tf a t 3 ge g Tf T 3 a tf a t 3 , 77 where T T t i st h et e m p e r a t u r eo ft h ep h o t o n sa n dg 2i st h ed e g e n e r a c yf a c t o r for photons. But now we can use entropy conservation eqn. 73 to write g?S Tf T3 f a3 f g?S T T3a3 Tf T 3 a tf a t 3 g?S T g?S Tf . 78 Plugging this in above \ufb01nally gives n t nCMB t ge 2 g?S T g?S Tf . 79 This illustrates that the number density of any relic background of relativistic particles is comparable to the number density of CMB photons. Note that this equation also remains valid even if the particles later become non relativistic by redshifting away their energy and momentum such thatkBT tNR mc2 some time after decoupling where tNR t f . 4 Neutrino Decoupling Neutrinos are fermions spin 1 2p a r t i c l e s t h a ti n t e r a c to n l yv i at h ew e a kf o r c ea n dg r a v i t y . They are electrically neutral and have a massm c2 . 0.1e V i . e .. 2 10 7 times smaller than the electron such that they will esentially always be relativistic. There areN three \ufb02avors of neutrinos electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos, and tau neutrinos, although only the electron neutrinos take part in electromagnetic interactions. Since neutrinos are spin 1 2 fermions we expect their degeneracy factorg to be g 2. However, only one of these spin states, so calledleft handed or active neutrinos have ever been observed, so we will assume g 1. Neutrinos with the other spin state are calledright handed or sterile neutrinos, which are hypothetical particles which are postulated to interact only via gravity but not via the fundamental interactions of the Standard Model. Sterile neutrinos have been advocated as possible candidates for the dark matter. In what follows we focus on the active neutrinos which decoupled around 1s after the Big Bang and calculate the temperature of the cosmic neutrino background, which we argued previously has a temperatureT 4 11 TCMB. Neutrinos maintain thermal equilibrium with the primordial plasma through interactions 21 Figure 4 Thermal history through electron positron annihilation. Neutrinos are decoupled and their temperature redshifts simply asT a 1.T h e e n e r g y d e n s i t y a n d e n t r o p y o f the electron positron pairs are transferred to the photon gas whose temperature therefore redshifts more slowly,T g 1 3 ?S T a 1. Figure taken from Baumann such as p e n e p e n e n p e e e e e e e e e e 80 down to a thermal energy of 1 MeV, which corresponds roughly to 1 second after the Big Bang. Below this energy threshold these reactions become ine cient and they decouple. We can calculate roughly the 1 MeV scale of decoupling in the following way. Using eqn. 5 with vrel c, since the tiny neutrino mass guarantees they will be relativistic we will check this , one gets H n c H 81 22 Noting thatH T2 Mpl recall thatH2 a 4 for a radiation dominated universe, and T a 1,s o H T2 , that GFT2 where GF is Fermi s constant, andn T3 for a relativistic species, gives H n c H G2 F c 6 MPlc2 kBT 3 kBT 1M e V 3 . 82 Thus when kBT 1 MeV decoupling occurs. Note that our assumption that neutrinos are massless is valid since their mass energy is much smaller than the energy at which they decouple m c2 . 0.1e V kBT 1M e V . At temperatures above the electron mass energymec2 511 keV electrons and positrons are spontaneously created from the photon bath e e 83 Shortly after neutrinos decouple atkBT 1M e V t h e t e m p e r a t u r e d r o p s b e l o w t h e e l e c t r o n mass ofmec2 5 1 1k e V 4 sa f t e rt h eB i gB a n g . A tt h i sp o i n tt h ep a i r p r o d u c t i o nr e a c t i o n above decouples and will only proceed to the right. As a result electrons and positrons will be exponentially supressed, i.e. according to our calculation for a non relativistic species see eqn. 41 ne ge mkBT 2 2 3 2 e mec2 kBT . 84 The energy density and entropy of the electrons and positrons is transferred to the photon bath, but not to the neutrinos, which decoupled earlier. The photons are thus heated relative to the neutrinos, which is to say that the decoupled neutrino temperature decreases as a 1, whereas the photon temperture decreases more slowly, as shown in Fig. 4. The slower decrease is a direct result of the fact that the conserved quantity is the entropy, and hence T g 1 3 ?S T a 1 and so the photon temperature decreases more slowly thana 1 precisely because g?S T i sd e c r e a s e dw h e nt h ee l e c t r o n sa n dp o s i t r o nd e g r e e so ff r e e d o mv a n i s h . B u t the neutrinos do not feel the impact of this heating because they already froze out earlier. We now determine what the neutrino temperature should be explicitly using the conservation of entropy. At a certain scale factora1 prior toe e annihilation and neutrino decoupling, photons, electrons positrons, and neutrinos were all in equilibrium at temperatureT a1 , which we will denote asT 1.A tt h i se p o c ht h ee n t r o p yd e n s i t yh a dt h ev a l u e s a1 2 2 45 3c3 g?S T 1 kBT 1 3, 85 where g?S T 1 2 z photons electrons positrons z 7 8 2 2 7 8N g g z neutrinos anti neutrinos , 86 23 where N is the number of neutrino \ufb02avors andg is the neutrino degeneracy factor. Note that we have assumed the same temperatureT 1 for all particles since they are all in equilibrium with the thermal bath ata1. Now consider some later scale factora2 after e e annihilation and hence also after neutrino decoupling. Now the electrons and positrons are exponentially rare and the total entropy density is s a2 2 2 45 3c3 g?S T 2 kBT 2 3, 87 where g?S T 2 2 T 2 T 2 3 z photons neutrinos anti neutrinos z 7 8N g g T T 2 3 2 7 4N g T T 2 3 , 88 where we note that there are two relevant temperatures ata2,t h et e m p e r a t u r eo ft h et h e r m a l bath T 2,a n dt h ed e c o u p l e dn e u t r i n ot e m p e r a t u r eT . Invoking conservation of entropysa3,w ec a ne q u a t e s a1 a3 1 s a2 a3 2 89 or a1T 1 3 2 7 4 2 N g a2T 2 3 2 7 4N g T T 2 3 , 90 We now have an expression relating three temperaturesT 1,t h et e m p e r a t u r ew h e np h o t o n s , electrons positrons, and neutrinos were all in LTEa1,a n dt w ot e m p e r a t u r e sa ta2 after neutrino decoupling and electron positron annihilation,T 2 and T ,t h ed i s t i n c tp h o t o na n d neutrino temperatures. Whereas, what we desire is a relationship between two temperatures, the decoupled neutrino temperatureT and the temperature of the CMB. Note that sincea2 is after electron positron annihilation, and neutrino decoupling, only the two photon degrees of freedom occupy the so called thermal bath, in other words, we just have a thermal bath of photons coupled to baryons and leptons, but recall that non relativistic particles contribute no signi\ufb01cant energy or entropy and decoupled neutrinos which travel along geodesics . After this point the photon temperatureT a a 1 all the way up to the present epoch since there will be no further changes in the number of relativistic degrees of freedom, i.e. T 2 is just the CMB temperature ata2.B u t b y t h e s a m e r e a s o n i n g ,T 2 6 a1 a2 T 1 e.g. see Fig. 4 . So in order to eliminateT 1 we need to use the fact that the neutrinos are just traveling along geodesics and not interacting with anything anymore. This means that their energy is simply being redshifted away by Hubble drag, i.e.T a since the timea1 at which they were in thermal equilibrium. An equivalent way to state exactly the same thing is to say 24 that their entropy isseparately conservedsince they decoupled, that is s T3 and s a3 c o n s t T a 1, 91 which implies T a1 a2 T 1, 92 Using this in eqn. 90 \ufb01nally gives T T 4 11 1 3 , 93 where we have substitutedT 2 T given our realization above that this is just the CMB temperature which evolves asT a 1 up to the present. The expression above remarkably does not depend onN or g although the energy density does . Plugging in numbers we \ufb01nd that forT 0 2 .725 K, we getT 0 1 .945 K. Using the expressions for energy density in eqn. 37 , one can easily show 7 8N g 4 11 4 3 , 94 where is the energy density of the CMB. We used these two contributions, CMB and neutrinos, to determine the total radiation energy density today r,0 7 .8 10 34 gc m 3 or r,0 8.6 10 5, 95 in a past lecture. 5 The Boltzmann Equation Thus far we have not dealt with the possibility of departues from LTE. We have either assumed LTE, or as in the case of neutrino decoupling, used entropy conservation to relate di erent times in the universe s thermal history where some departure from LTE ocurred. But in order to treat other fundamental issues in the Universe s thermal history like the possibility of dark matter being athermal relic, the recombination of electrons with protons at decoupling, and the synthesis of the light elements, we need to be able to understand departures from equilibrium. The formal tool to describe the evolution beyond equilibrium is the Boltzmann equation, which appears extraordinarily simple although solutions can be incredibly complicated. For some species of particlei it reads dfi dt Ci f . 96 Here fi is the one particle distribution function andCi f i st h ec o l l i s i o n a lt e r m5 that depends on fi,a sw e l la sa l lo t h e rd i s t r i b u t i o nf u n c t i o n sfj which particle i can interact with. Note 5Because Ci depends on a set of functions it is actually formally a functional. 25 that Ci f m u s tn a t u r a l l yd e p e n do nt h ec r o s s s e c t i o n sa n dr e l a t i v em o m e n t ao fa l lo ft h e s e particles, and will thus in general involve integrals over their respective distribution functions. Thus for a set ofN di erent particle species, the Boltzmann equation is actually a set of N coupled integrodi erential equations for the full set of phase space distribution functions fi.F o r t u n a t e l y ,f o rm a n yp r a c t i c a lc o s m o l o g i c a la p p l i c a t i o n s ,t h e r ea r ew a y st os i m p l i f yt h e calculations. The one particle distribution function above is a function of timet,o ft h ep a r t i c l ep o s i t i o n x and the momentap, f x, p,t . But note thatx and p are themselves functions of time because of the particle motion. Thus the time derivative that we wrote above is actually a convective derivative analogous to in \ufb02uid mechanics, and it actually becomes dfi dt fi t dx dt r xfi dp dt r pfi. 97 In the current cosmological context, we can simplify this derivative in a few ways. First note that by homogeneityrxfi 0 ,a sw ea r g u e dp r e v i o u s l yw h e nd i s c u s s i n ge q u i l i b r i u m distribution functions. Furthermore, dpk dt dpk da a Hpk, 98 where the last equality used the fact that Hubble drag impliesp a 1,a n dh e n c e dpk da pk a . 99 Thus the Boltzmann equation simpli\ufb01es to dfi dt fi t Hp r pfi Ci f . 100 Now we can integrate the equation above over mometnum space R d3p 2 3,a l s ok n o w n as taking the zeroth moment , to obtain an expression for the number densityni dni dt 3 Hni Z d3p 2 3 Ci f , 101 where the \ufb01rst term on the left hand side is obvious6, the second term on the left is less obvious but obtainable by integrating by parts7,a n dt h er i g h th a n ds i d ei ss o m ev e r yd i c u l t thing to calculate depending on the set of particle interactions you are dealing with. This form of the Boltzman equation in terms ofni for a homogenous and isotropic universe 6You may have noticed that there is a missing degeneracy factorgi here. Just assume we have incorporated that into the distribution functionfi 7This is relatively straightforward to show, i.e. you get terms like R dp4 p3d f dp, and uv part of the integration by parts vanishes provided thatf p ! 0 as p !1 as any well behaved distribution function should. 26 becomes even more intuitive if we write it as 1 a3 d nia3 dt Z d3p 2 3 Ci f C0 i nj . 102 In this form it lends itself to an intuitive interpretation. In the absence of collisionsC0 0 , the Boltzman equation indicates thatnia3 is a conserved quantity. Since n represents a physical proper number density, this states that the universal Hubble expansion causes the volume of a region containing a \ufb01xed number of particles to grow asa3,a n dh e n c et h e physical number density of these particles falls o asa 3.E q u i v a l e n t l y w e c a n s a y t h a t i n the absence of collisions the comoving number densityN na3 is conserved. Sometimes we will describe this collisionless scenario by saying that the particles are traveling along geodesics , or expanding with the Hubble \ufb02ow . The collisions with other particlesnj, encapsulated in the collision termC0 i nj , causes departures from these geodesics. Let us now consider the impact of these collisions. Because interactions between three or more particles are very unlikely, for concreteness let us focus our attention on the number densityn1 of a single particle species 1, and that the only process a ecting the abundance of this species is an annihilation with species 2, producing two particles, which we will call 3 and 4. Similarly the inverse process can also occur 3 and 4 can also combine to produce particles 1 and 2. We can represent this reaction as 1 2 3 4 . 103 Clearly the rate of change in the abundance of species 1 is given by the di erence betweeen the rates for producing and eliminating the species. For this simple case the collision term simpli\ufb01es and we can write the Boltzmann equation as8 1 a3 d n1a3 dt T n1n2 T n3n4. 104 The right hand side can be understood as follows. The \ufb01rst term, n1n2,d e s c r i b e st h e rate of destruction of species 1, whereas the second term, n3n4 describes its creation rate when 3 and 4 come together. It is intuitive that the destruction rate is proportional ton1 and n2 and the creation rate proportional ton3 and n4.T h e p a r a m e t e r T c a nb ew r i t t e n as T h vi, 105 where is the interaction cross section for the 1 2a n n i h i l a t i o nr e a c t i o nt h a tp r o d u c e s 3 4p a r t i c l e s ,a n dv is the relative velocity between the projectile particles 1 and the target particles 2. The angle brackets indicate that we are using the appropriate velocity 8This equation is actually an approximation. See Dodelson 3.1, Piatella 3.8, or Kolb and Turner 5.1 for the details of what is actually being assumed here. We are essentially assuming that all the reactants have a Maxwell Boltzmann distribution and are coupled to the thermal bathT. For example if the reaction was e e , then the charge of the electrons and positrons and electromagnetic interactions enforce kinetic equilibrium between them and the thermal bath. The Maxwell Boltzmann assumption is equivalent to saying the occupation numbers of all the particle species are low, i.e. we are neglecting Fermi blocking and Bose enhancement e ects. 27 distribution averaged cross section, and it is intuitive that this should be a function of the temperature of the thermal bathT. Now we can relate T t o T by noting that if the system were in thermal equilibrium, the left hand side of the Boltzmann equation would have to be zero. This is a common trick in statistical mechanics where you hypothetically take the system to thermodynamic equilibrium to determine the relationship between forward and backward reaction rates. Speci\ufb01cally it allows you to express the ratio of forward and backward reaction rates as ratios of equilibrium number densities. In this other context it goes by the name of thelaw of mass actionand the principle ofdetailed balance. The beauty of this trick is that even though we are discussing a non equilibrium situation, we can still obtain a realtionship between forward and backward rates, by insisting that they be equal in equilibrium. Applying this argument to the case at hand we \ufb01nd that the relationship between T a n d T h vi must be n0 1n0 2 n0 3n0 4 h vi, 106 where n0 i are the number densities in thermal equilibrium which we calculated previously. Thus we can recast the Boltzmann equation as 1 a3 d n1a3 dt h vin1n2 1 n3n4 n1n2 n0 3n0 4 n0 1n0 2 . 107 6 Dark Matter and Thermal Relics We will now discuss the idea that dark matter could be a thermal relic of the Hot Big Bang. The idea here is that at some point in the Universe s thermal history dark matter was in thermal equilibrium with particles from the standard model which make up the photon bath, and that it satis\ufb01ed H. As the universe expanded and cooled this reaction eventually freezes out when H, and we are left with arelic abundance of cold dark matter particles. If we can calculate this abundance, we can put constraints on the cross section and mass of the dark matter particles by requiring that this abundance match the amount of cold dark matter in the universe determined from cosmological observations. This topic is obviously speculative because it requires that we make assumptions about the physical nature of the unknown dark matter particles. For concreteness, we will focus on the hypothesis that dark matter is composed ofweakly interacting massive particles WIMPs . Consider the following process X X l l, 108 where X represents the dark matter particle andl is a lepton. The Boltzman equation for the number density ofX, nX,i s 1 a3 d nXa3 dt h vinXn X 1 nXn X n0 Xn0 X 1, nln l n0 l n0 l . 109 28 We will assume that thel particles are in thermal equilibrium with the photon bath, and thus we can writen0 l nl.F u r t h e r w e w i l l n e g l e c t a n y p a r t i c l e a n t i p a r t i c l e a s s y m e t r y f o r the dark matter and simply writenX n X.T h ee q u a t i o na b o v et h e ns i m p l i \ufb01 e st o 1 a3 d nXa3 dt h vin2 X 1 n0 X nX 2 . 110 At this point it is instructive to recast the Boltzmann equation by de\ufb01ningcomoving nubmer densitiesNi nia3,w h i c hs e r v e st or e m o v et h ed i l u t i o no fn u m b e rd e n s i t yd u e to the universal expansion. With this we can write d ln NX d ln a a H a 1 N0 X NX 2 111 where we have de\ufb01ned the interaction rate nXh vi, 112 and used the fact that d dt H d d ln a. 113 Finally, note that if we consider times when the number of degrees of freedom are not changing, thena 1 T, we can also equivalently adopt a new time coordinate that highlights when interesting things are expected to happen, namely when the dark matter particle of mass m transitions from being relativistic to non relativistic. For this calculation we are most interested in cold dark matter, which is to say acold thermal relicthat decouples from the photon bath when it is non relativistic, although in the homework you will consider a hot thermal relic,w h i c hi sas p e c i e st h a td e c o u p l e sw h e ni ti ss t i l lr e l a t i v i s t i c . W e know that the number density of a particle will be exponentially suppressed when it goes non relativistic, resulting in a similar suppression of , and ultimately decoupling. This motivates us to de\ufb01ne x mc2 kBT , 114 where m is the mass of the dark matter particle. Becausex T 1 a,i ta l s oc o n s t i t u t e s at i m ec o o r d i n a t e ,b u tam o r eu s e f u lo n es i n c ex 1h i g h l i g h t sw h e nt h ep a r t i c l ei sg o i n g non relativistic.

You will see all variants of this rescaling in cosmology books, and we will switch to scaling by the entropy in just a moment. This form of the Boltzmann 29 equation for thermal relics has no analytic solution, and must be solved numerically which we will come to next, but \ufb01rst we discuss its qualitative behavior.

Relativistic DecouplingConsider early times when H and NX N0 X is setup. In the relativistic regime becausen0 X T3 a 3, N0 X does not change with time. So as decreases with the expansion and eventually crosses H,n o t h i n gh a p p e n ss i n c eN0 X is not a function of time andNX was closely tracking it previously. Although one was in equilibrium previously when H,i tw o u l db eg r o s s l yi n c o r r e c tt oc o n c l u d et h a to n ei ss t i l li ne q u i l i b r i u m when one transitions H since no interactions exist to maintain equilibrium. This is basically exactly the physical situation we described when we talked about a relativistic distribution function like the CMB, or the cosmic neutrino backbround being frozen in after decoupling. The equilibrium distribution function for the relativistic species is maintained after decoupling even though the species is no longer in thermal equilibrium. Non Relativistic Decoupling Recall that for a non relativistic species the equilibrium number density is n0 X mkBT 2 2 3 2 e mc2 kBT , 116 and usingx mc2 kBT , N0 X n0 Xa3 x3 2e x, 117 and thus N0 X transitions to a rapidly declining function ofx time when x 1, and the particle becomes non relativistic, as illustrated by the dashed curve in Fig. 5. Thus in order for NX to track the equilibriumN0 X the left hand side of eqn. 115 must therefore be a large 30 Figure 5 A schematic illustration of particle freeze out. At high temperatures,kBT mc2, the particle abundance tracks its equilibrium value. At low temperatures,kBT mc2, the particles freeze out and maintain a density that is much larger than the Boltzmann suppressed equilibrium abundance.

However this cannot be maintained forever, because the equilibrium abundance is being exponentially suppressed ultimately there will come at i m ew h e nt h eNX particles are so rare that they cannot \ufb01nd each other fast enough to maintain equilibrium.

Once H is reached, N0 X NX,a n dt h et e r mi nb r a c k e t sb e c o m e s negligible and we have d ln NX d ln x H 1 1 1 9 There is therefore a critical time when the reaction rate drops low enough that particles are simply conserved as the universe expands the particles havefrozen out.T h u s w e c a n write that N a !1 N H 1 . 120 Fig. 5 provides a schematic illustration of particle freeze out. 31 Let s now do a more quantitative analysis to con\ufb01rm this qualitative description and estimate the mass density in a cold thermal relic. As we mentioned in 3.8, it is often advantageous to work with the ratio of number density to entropy density owing to the fact that the total entropy of the universe is conserved. Recall that the total entropy density can be written s 2 2 45 3c3 g?S T kBT 3. 121 We thus de\ufb01ne the following quantities Y nX s ,Y eq n0 X s , 122 allowing us to write the Boltzmann equation as dY dt sh vi Y 2 Y 2 eq 123 Again, since most of the interesting dynamics will take place whenkBT mc2 we adopt the more convenient time coordinatex mc2 kBT.T o r e w r i t e t h e t i m e d e r i v a t i v e i n t e r m s o f x we note that dx dt d dt mc2 kBT x T dT dt Hx, 124 where we have assumed thatT a 1.R e c a l lt h a ti ng e n e r a lT3a3g?S T c o n s t ,s ow ea r e assuming that no major changes in the number of degrees of freedom occur over the times relevant to this particle freeze out so that we can writeg?S const g?S m . Since we are assuming that we are deep in the radiation dominated era recall thatH2 a 4 and hence H a 2 T2 x 2 so we can write H H m x2 , 125 where H m H x 1 is the Hubble parameter corresponding to a thermal energy kBT mc2.W et h e n\ufb01 n a l l ya r r i v ea tt h es o c a l l e dRiccati equation, dY dx x2 Y 2 Y 2 eq , 126 where 2 2 mc2 3h vig?S m 45H m 3c3 . 127 In this case chemical equilibrium would simply implyY Yeq and from eqn. 117 we know that Yeq ! 0f o rx !1 .O n t h e o t h e r h a n d , w e a l s o e x p e c t a s p e r t h e q u a l i t a t i v e d i s c u s s i o n above thatY attains an asymptotic value which we callY1 and with which we shall calculate the present abundance of dark matter. The departure from equilibriumY Yeq implied by the Boltzmann equation solution is what we described asfreeze out and, as we discussed, it takes place approximately when H. 32 Figure 6 Abundance of dark matter particles as the temperature drops below the mass, i.e. x mc2 kBT . Figure from Baumann. A numerical solution to eqn. 126 is shown in Fig. 6. In practical terms this is done by choosing a small initial value ofx xi and initalizing Y xi Yeq xi a n d\ufb01 x i n g to be a constant. Notice that parameterizes the interaction rate. One sees that the freeze out abundance Y1 decreases as increases. This makes intuitive sense larger interaction rates maintain equilibrium longer and H occurs deeper into the Boltzmann suppressed regime, resulting in a lower overall relic abundance. From inspection of Fig. 6 one observes also that the freeze out, i.e. when the abundance Y departs from Yeq,o c c u r sa r o u n dav a l u eo fxf 10. Morever, this value is very weakly dependent on ,b e c a u s eo ft h er a p i de x p o n e n t i a ld e c l i n eo fYeq, xf ln . We can now use what we have learned to relate the relic abundance to the dark matter cross section. For x x f,w ek n o wt h a tYeq drops rapidly to zero, and the Boltzmann equation can be written dY dx x2 Y 2 x x f . 128 33 Integrating fromxf to x 1,w e\ufb01 n d 1 Y1 1 Yf xf . 129 Now typically,Yf Y1 see 6 , so a simple analytical approximation is Y1 xf . 130 After freeze out whenY has attained Y1 the number of dark matter particles per unit of entropy is \ufb01xed recall the discussion in 3.8, that this is a conserved quantity if the dark matter particle number does not change after freeze out . We can now write down the present day energy density in dark matter as follows X0 nX0m mY1s0, 131 where s0 2 2 45 3c3 g?S T0 kBT0 3 132 is the present day entropy density. Or expressing this relative to the critical density we have X0 X0 crit,0 mxf s0 crit,0 , 133 where we used eqn. 130 . Combining eqn. 133 , 132 , and 127 we get X0 8 GH m xf kBT0 3 3H2 0 m2c6h vi g?S T0 g?S m . 134 Now we know how to calculateg?S T0 t o d a y g?S T0 X bosons gi Ti T0 3 7 8 X fermions gi Ti T0 3 photons z 2 T0 T0 3 7 8N 2g T T0 3 z neutrinos anti neutrinos 2 7 4 3 1 4 11 3 .91, 135 where in the last equality we used T T0 3 4 11. What about the Hubble parameterH m ? Using H2 m 8 G 3c2 R m 1 3 6 34 and recalling that R 2 30 3c3 g?

The Planck satellite has made a percent level measurement of the density in cold dark matter CDMh2 0 .1200 0.0012. The fact that a cross section with an order of magnitude characteristic of the weak interaction G2 F 10 10 GeV 2 gives the right order of magnitude for the cold dark matter abundance is what is known as theWIMP miracle. 35 Phys 236 Cosmology Lecture 8 Recombination and Decoupling An important event in the history of the early Universe is the formation of the \ufb01rst atoms. At temperatures above about 1 eV, the universe still consisted of a plasma of free electrons and nuclei. Photons were tightly coupled to the electrons via Compton scattering, which in turn strongly interacted with protons via Coulomb scattering. There was very little neutral hydrogen. When the temperature became low enough, the electrons and nuclei combined to form neutral atoms, and the density of free electrons fell sharply. This event which formed the \ufb01rst atoms in the Universe is known asrecombination. As the electrons disappear onto atoms the scattering rate of photons o of electrons drops below the expansion rate and the photons decouple from the matter and the universe becomes transparent, which is known as decoupling. Today, these photons are observed as the cosmic microwave background, and the fact that decoupling happened so abruptly explains why we appear to see CMB photons orginating from a surface known as thelast scattering surface, as shown in Fig. 1 Figure 1 An observer is surrounded by a spherical last scattering surface. The photons of the CMB travel straight to us from the last scattering surface, being continuously redshifted. The distance back to the last scattering surface atz 1100 is almost equal to our particle horizon. Figure taken from Ryden. 1 For these two events, recombination and decoupling, the relevant interactions are p e H , e e . 1 Decoupling occurs just after recombination for the obvious reason that it is the disapearance of the electrons onto atoms that causes the Thompson scattering rate to plummett thus freeing the photons from the plasma. 1 Recombination 1.1 Baryon to Photon Ratio Previously we noted that if the particle number is not changing, then becausen a 3 and s a 3,t h e i rr a t i o ,t h en u m b e ro fp a r t i c l e sp e ru n i te n t r o p y , Ni ni s 2 is a conserved quantity which behaves like a comoving number density provided that particles are not being created or destroyed anymore. A useful application of this is to the number of baryons. Provided that baryon number nonconserving interactions if they even exist are occuring very slowly then nB s nB n B s, 3 and so this ratio is a constant since the epoch of baryogenesis when the baryon assymmetry was put in place. The ratio of baryons to entropy is related to an important quantity that we will use in studies of both recombination and Big Bang nucleosynthesis BBN , which is the baryon to photon ratio nB n 4 Recall that s 2 2 45 3c3 g?S T kBT 3 and n 2 kBT 3 3 2 3c3 , 5 which implies s 1 .80g?S T n . 6 Thus nB s s n 1 .80g?S T nB s . 7 Unlike nB s,i ng e n e r a lt h eb a r y o nt op h o t o nr a t i oi sn o tac o n s e r v e dq u a n t i t y .S p e c i \ufb01 c a l l y eqn. 6 states that when the number of degrees of freedom changes,g?S T , so will the total number of photons, and thus . However, we know that sincee e annihilation at around T 500 keV, or about 4s after the Big Bang, the number of degrees of freedom has not 2 changed and g?S T . 500 keV photons z 2 7 8N 2g T T 3 z neutrinos anti neutrinos 2 7 4 3 1 4 11 3 .91, 8 so we \ufb01nd that 7nB s 9 is also a conserved quantity since that time. We can calculate as follows. Recalling that 0 2 kBT0 4 2 30 3c3 , 10 we use eqn. 5 above to write n 0 0 30 3 4kBT0 , 11 and therefore nB0 n 0 B0 mpc2n 0 4kBT0 B0 30 3 mpc2 0 4kBT0 B0 30 3 mpc2 0 5 .5 10 10 B0h2 0.020 . 12 Note that the entropy of the Universe per particle is enormous and unlike any other physical system that we are used to considering. For example in a star like our sun thenB n 100. Even in the post collapse core of a supernovaenB n af e w . 1.2 Saha Equilibrium Recombination concerns two reactions. The \ufb01rst is the destruction of hydrogen atoms via the photoelectric e ect H ! p e , 13 which can occur if the photon has an energyh 13.6e V BH.T h i s r e a c t i o n c a n a l s o run in the opposite direction which is known asradiative recombination p e ! H . 14 When does the recombination phase transition, and the consequent decoupling of photons take place? We can obtain a quick and dirty estimate of the recombination temperature. One might argue that recombination must take place when the mean energy per photon in the cosmic microwave background falls below the ionization potential of the hydrogen atom, BH 1 3.6 eV. When this happens the average CMB photon is no longer able to photoionize hydrogen. Since the mean photon energy for a black body distribution isE 2.7kBT,t h i s 3 naive argument would suggest a recombination temperature of Trec BH 2.7kB 60, 000 K zrec 20, 000. 15 But we know the surface of last scattering is aroundzdec 1100, so what did we do wrong here? Obviously we ignored the fact that photons are not just at the mean temperature, but have a distribution functinof p . More importantly, this calculation neglects that photons outnumber baryons by a gigantic factor, namely 1 2 109.T h u s a n y n e w l y f o r m e d a t o m will be surrounded by over a billion photons, and it is thus not the mean energy of those photons that matters, but whether a photon in the extreme tail of the distribution is still energetic enough to ionize hydrogen. Apparently the temperature actually needs to be much lower for atomic hydrogen to survive, such that even among 2b i l l i o np h o t o n sp e rb a r y o n we cannot \ufb01nd one photon energetic enough to ionize hydrogen. What we have learned is that the recombination process, or more precisely the relative fraction of hydrogen which is ionized, has to depend on the baryon to photon ratio. Let s work out the mathematics behind this using the equilibrium distribution functions that we have learned about. We will make some simplifying assumptions here. First, we will assume the Universe is a pure hydrogen plasma so that we don t need to worry about Helium nuclei. We will learn in the next lecture that the universe is actually 10 Helium by number or about 25 Helium by mass, so this is not going to be a big correction, but it does simplify the math. Second, and more important, we will calculate the fraction of the total hydrogen which is ionized assuming LTE. This turns out to be a good approximation at early times, but then breaks down as recombination proceeds, because the reactions above fall out of chemical equilibrium. We will work out the full non equilibrium treatment next. Our goal is to follow thefree electron fractionor ionized fraction as a function of time Xe ne np nH ne nB np nB , 16 where our assumption of a pure hydrogen plasma impliesnB np nH and np ne. Consider LTE between the electrons, protons, neutral atoms, and photons. In this case we can write the reactions above as p e H . 17 LTE implies that all particles obey the equilibrium distributions we derived previously, and that we also have chemical equilibrium \u00b5p \u00b5e \u00b5H, 18 where we have used the fact that photons have zero chemical potential\u00b5 0. Now that we are interested in chemical equilibrium, we need to retain the chemical potential in all the distribution functions. 4 Figure 2 Free electron fraction as a function of redshift.

With this, eqn. 20 becomes nH n2 e 2 2 mekBT 3 2 eBH kBT . 22 Now note that the left hand side nH n2 e 1 nB 1 Xe X2 e , 23 and we can write the total baryon density in terms of the baryon to photon ratio nB n 2 kBT 3 3 2 3c3 , 24 where we used eqn. 5 above. We then arrive at the so calledSaha equation, 1 Xe X2 e 2 3 2 2 kBT mec2 3 2 eBH kBT . 25 Fig. 2 shows the the redshift evolution of the free electron fraction as predicted both by the Saha equation above, and the more exact full non equilibrium treatment using the Boltzmann see below . The Saha approximation, which assumes LTE, correctly identi\ufb01es the onset of recombination, but it is clearly insu cient if the aim is to determine the relic density of elec trons after freeze out, since the Saha solution is just based on equilibrium thermodynamics and knows nothing about the reaction rate relative to the Hubble time. 1.3 Time of Recombination Let us de\ufb01ne the recombination temperatureTrec as the temperature whereXe 0 .1, that is when 90 of the electrons have combined with protons to form neutral hydrogen. This choice is obviously somewhat arbitrary, but given that the Saha solution saysXe plummets exponentially, it won t matter much what we choose. Furthermore this is a regime where LTE still appears to be a reasonably valid assumption given the curves in Fig. 2. We \ufb01nd Trec 3600 K 0.3e V kB . 26 Thus we con\ufb01rm that 3600 K 60, 000 K 0.3e V 5e V a s w e a r g u e d e a r l i e r m u s t b e the case because photons outnumber baryons by such a large number, and we see that it is enforced in eqn. 25 whereXe depends on .

We can estimate the redshift of recombination as follows Trec T0 1 zrec , 28 and plugging in the temperature of the CMB todayT0 2 .7K , g i v e s zrec 1320. 29 Since we previously estimated that matter radiation equality is atzeq 3500, we conclude that recombination occurred in the matter dominated era. Using a t t t0 2 3 , 30 appropriate for a matter dominated universe, we can estimate the time of recombination to be trec t0 1 zrec 3 2 290, 000 yrs. 31 1.4 Electron Freeze Out In Fig. 2 we see that a residual ionization fraction of electrons freezes out when the interac tions in eqn. 17 become ine cient. To follow the free electron fraction after freeze out, we need to solve the Boltzmann equation, just as we did for the dark matter freeze out. One can obtain an order of magnitude estimate by applying the criterion T neh vi H T , 32 which you will do in the homework. Here the velocity averaged cross section is there combination rate coe cient.T h i s t u r n s o u t t o b e n o t c o m p l e t e l y t r i v i a l t o c a l c u l a t e . Ground state recombinations lead to production of an ionizing photon, and this photon im mediately ionizes a neutral atom. The net e ect of such a recombination is zero no new neutral atoms are formed this way. The only way for recombination to proceed is via capture to one of the excited states of hydrogen to a good approximation, this rate is h vi recc BH kBT 1 2 , 33 where rec 1 .27 10 24 cm2.I n t h e l a n g u a g e o f t h e P h y s i c s o f t h e I n t e r s t e l l a r a n d I n t e r galactic Medium Phys 233 , we want the case B recombination rate B T , for which the recombinations to the ground state which have no net e ect on the ionization equilibrium, are excluded from the rate coe cient calculation. 7 Recall that the Boltzmann equation reads 1 a3 d n1a3 dt h vin1n2 1 n3n4 n1n2 n0 3n0 4 n0 1n0 2 34 We can taken1 ne, n2 np ne, n3 nH,a n dn4 n n0 because photons always follow their equilibrium distribution both pre and post decoupling. Plugging these in we \ufb01nd 1 a3 d nea3 dt h vi n2 e n0 e 2 nH n0 H . 35 We will further make the approximation that nH n0 H 1. 36 Since we will be interested in times after freeze out whereXe 1a n dh e n c enH nB it is reasonable to set this term to unity. So we obtain 1 a3 d nea3 dt h vi n2 e n0 e 2 37 Writing thatne nBXe the left hand side is 1 a3 d nea3 dt 1 a3 d XenBa3 dt 1 a3 dXe dt nBa3 Xe d nBa3 dt nB dXe dt , 38 where the last equality used the fact thatnBa3 c o n s ti sj u s tt h ec o m o v i n gb a r y o nd e n s i t y , and henced nBa3 dt 0 .

Then the Hubble constant is just H z H0 p m0 1 z 3 2 H0 p m0 T T0 3 2 x 3 2 42 8 since T T0 1 z . So we can writeH x H x 1 x 3 2. Finally, nB B mp b0 cr0 mpa3 3H2 0 B0 8 Gmpa3 a 3 x 3 43 since a T 1 x.T h u sw ec a nw r i t e nB nB x 1 x 3, 44 and we \ufb01nally obtain dXe dx x2 X2 e Xeq e 2 , 45 where nB x 1 recc H x 1 3 .9 103. 46 Notice that eqn. 45 is identical in form to the Ricatti equation that we derived for dark mat ter freeze out. We can therefore immediately write down the electron freeze out abundance, as we did before X1 e xf 0 .9 10 3 xf 45 , 47 where we have plugged in numbers for xf xrec kBTrec BH 0.3e V 13.6e V 4 5 4 8 using the value of Trec 3 6 0 0 Kw ed e r i v e df r o mt h eS a h ae q u a t i o nb ya s s u m i n gt h a t recombination occurs when Xeq e 0 .1. This is reasonably close to the true value, but slightly overestimated. This residual abundance of electrons is important for two reasons. First, they are required to catalyze the formation of molecular hydrogen later on, and molecular hydrogen is crucial to cool gas to low enough temperatures so that the \ufb01rst stars can form. Second, as we will see momentarily, the photons stop scattering o of the electrons just afer recombination. However, because the photon to baryon ratio is so high 109,t h e s er a r es c a t t e r i n ge v e n t s between electrons and photons nevertheless continue to heat the electrons, which transfer this heat to the protons via Coulomb interactions. As a result, the temperature of the baryons remains coupled to that of the radiation and drops of asT a 1, instead of theT a 2 that a frozen out non relativistic gas would usually follow in the absence of interactions. Thus the temperature of the baryons follows the temperature of the CMB until much later times z 150 than recombination decoupling. 9 2 Photon Decoupling As stated earlier, photons are most strongly coupled to the primordial plasma through their scattering interactions with electrons e e , 49 which has an interaction rate given by ne T c XenB T c 50 where T 6 .65 10 23 cm2 is the Thompson cross section. Since ne,t h ei n t e r a c t i o n rate decreases as the density of free electrons drops. Photons and electrons decouple roughly when the interaction rate becomes smaller than the expansion rate, Tdec H Tdec . 51 Again using eqn. 43 fornB a 3 and eqn. 42 forH z i nam a t t e rd o m i n a t e du n i v e r s e , we can derive H 1 1 3Xe z b0h2 0.02 m0h2 0.15 1 2 1 z 1000 3 2 . 52 The redshift of decouplingzdec is de\ufb01ned to be that for which H 1. Note that in the above equation Xe is a function of redshift, which we have plotted in Fig. 2. One can see that Xe drops abruptly during recombination, the factor of 113 in the equation above is easily overcome. For this reason recombination and decoupling happen at roughly the same time. The redshift and time of decoupling are zdec 1090 53 tdec 380, 000 yr 54 After decoupling the photons stream freely. Observations of the cosmic microwave back ground today allow us to probe the conditions at last scattering. 10 Phys 236 Cosmology Lecture 9 Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Let us return toT 1M e V . P h o t o n s , e l e c t r o n s , p o s i t r o n s , n e u t r i n o s a n d a n t i n e u t r i n o s a r e in thermal equilibrium. The neutrinos are about to decouple. Baryons are non relativistic and therefore much fewer in number than the relativistic species as expressed by the ex tremely small baryon to photon ratio 5 10 10. Nevertheless, we now want to study what happened to these trace amounts of baryonic matter. The total number of nucleons stays constant due to baryon number conservation. This baryon number can be in the form of protons and neutrons or heavier nuclei. Weak nuclear reactions may convert neutrons and protons into each other and strong nuclear reactions may build nuclei from them. In this lecture, we will learn how the light elements hydrogen s isotope deuterium, helium, and lithium were synthesized in the Big Bang. It turns out that the primordial synthesis of these elements provides one of the earliest and most stringest tests of the standard cosmology, and an important test of particle physics. As we will discuss, the present state of agreement be tween theory and observation indicates that the standard cosmology is a valid description of the universe at least back to times as early 10 2 sec after the Big Bang and temperatures as high as 10 MeV. In its full generality, BBN is a very complicated process involving many coupled Boltzmann equations to track all the nuclear abundances, informed by collision strengths for all of the nuclear reactions. In practice, however, two simpli\ufb01cations will make our life much easier 1. No elements heaver than helium. For reasons that we will explain, essentially no elements heavier than helium are pro duced at appreciable levels. So the only nuclei that we need to track are hydrogen and helium, and their isotopes deuterium, tritium, and3He. 2. Only neutrons and protons above 0.1 MeV. Above T 0.1 MeV only free protons and neutrons exist, while other light nuclei haven t been formed yet. Therefore, we can \ufb01rst solve for the neutron proton ratio and then use this abundance as the initial conditions for the synthesis of deuterium, helium, etc. At some level the zeroth order goal of this lecture is to provide a theoretical explanation for one number the ratio of the density of helium to hydrogen nHe nH 1 16 or by mass Y 4He B 1 4 1 1 Lightning Introduction to Nuclear Physics A single proton is a hydrogen nucleus, referred to as 1H or simply p 2 1 Ap r o t o na n dan e u t r o nm a k eu pd e u t e r i u m 2Ho r D. 3 One proton and two neutrons make tritium 3Ho r T. 4 Nuclei with two protons are helium these can have one neutron 3He or two neutrons 4He. 5 Thus unique elements have a \ufb01xed number ofZ protons, and isotopes of a given element have di ering numbers of neutrons. The total number of nucleons, i.e. neutrons and protons, in the nucleus, is known as theatomic numberor mass numberA,w h i c hi sl i s t e da sa superscript before the name of the element. The total mass of a nucleus withZ protons andA Z neutrons di ers slightly from the mass of the individual protons and neutrons alone. This di erence is called the binding energy, de\ufb01ned as BA Zmpc2 A Z mnc2 mAc2, 6 where mp and mn are the mass of the proton and neutron, respectively, andmA is the mass of the nucleus. For example, the mass of deuterium is 1875.62 MeV while the sum of the neutron and proton masses is 1877.84 MeV, so the binding energy of deuterium is 2.22 MeV. Although the nucleons have GeV mass energy, nuclear binding energies are typically in the MeV range, which explains why Big Bang nucleosynthesis occurs at temperatures a bit less than 1 MeV. The binding energyBA of a nucleus is the energy required to pull it apart into its component protons and neutrons. Equivalently, it is the energy released when a nucleus is fused together from individual protons and neutrons. I \ufb01nd it helpful to consider the analogy with ionization and recombination processes, which are typically more familiar. For example, we just studied the reaction p e H 7 where is a photon, and we know that photon energies in excess of the binding energy BH 1 3.6 eV are required to ionize hydrogen. This can be compared to the reaction which synthesizes deuterium p n D , 8 where in order to break D we require a gamma ray photon more energetic than the binding energy of Deuterium BD 2 .22 MeV. The deuteron is in fact not very tightly bound compared to other atomic nuclei. Fig. 1 plots the binding energy per necleuonBA A for atomic nuclei with di erent mass numbers. Note that4He has a very highBA A 7 . 0 7 or total binding energyBA 2 8.30 MeV making it relatively tightly bound compared to other light nuclei withA 10. The most tightly bound nuclei are those of56Fe, 58Fe, and 2 61Ni. Thus nuclei less massive than iron or nickel can release energy by fusion merging into heavier nuclei. Whereas nuclei more massive than iron or nickel can release energy by \ufb01ssion splitting into lighter nuclei. Finally, we will quantify abundances of the light elements via the mass fraction of a nuclear species A Z , XA nAA nB nB nn np X A AnA, 9 where P A XA 1a n dnB n is the total number density of baryons whether bound or free and is the baryon to photon ratio.

Note that kBTnuc is the temperature at which NSE predicts an order unity abundance given the universe s very small baryon to photon ratio . 2 Nuclear Statisitcal Equilibrium Similar to our approach when discussing recombination, we will \ufb01rst derive the equilbrium abundances of several relevant species, and then consider how these equilbrium abundances di er from the full non equilibrium treatment using the Boltzmann equation, which correctly describes what happens when H. 2.1 Neutrons First let s consider neutrons and protons which constitute the basic building blocks for nucleosynthesis. Indeed, we will see that esentially all of the neutrons in the universe get incorporated into4He.

This di erence in mass is important in the exponential, but can be neglected where it appears as a ratio in the pre factor, i.e.mn mp 1. In additiongn gp 1a sb o t hh a v e the same spin. Figure 2 Numerical results for helium production in the early universe. Figure from Bau mann. As for the chemical potentials, consider the second reaction listed above. Chemical equilib rium implies \u00b5n \u00b5 \u00b5p \u00b5e \u00b5n \u00b5p \u00b5e \u00b5 . 13 So we can rewrite eqn. 11 as nn np e x p Q kBT \u00b5e \u00b5 kBT exp Q kBT , 14 5 where in the last approximation we used the fact that the chemical potential of electrons and neutrinos \u00b5 kBT 1. For electrons, you showed in the homework that this results from the charge neutrality of the universe and the extremely small baryon to photon ratio. For neutrinos this is an assumption that is very likely to be true1. Thus we see that forT 1 MeV, there are as many neutrons as protons. However, for T 1 MeV, the neutron fraction is exponentially suppressed as shown in Fig. 2. Recall that Q mn mp c2 1.30 MeV, thus protons are the lower energy bound state , and as the universe cools down it is not energetically favorable to have any neutrons around. This is exactly the same principle behind forming the \ufb01rst atoms during recombination, i.e. the bound state H is energetically preferred once you cool down enough. If the weak interactions would operate e ciently enough to maintain equilibrium inde\ufb01nitely, then the neutron abundance would drop to zero. Luckily, in the real world the weak interactions are not so e cient. To get the \ufb01nal freeze out abundancenn np we will need to do a full non equilibrium Boltzmann calculation, which we will come to momentarily. 2.2 Deuterium Now let s consider deuterium,2H, an isotope of hydrogen with one proton and one neutron. BBN takes place through a series of two body reactions, building heavier nuclei step by step. The essential \ufb01rst step is the fusion of a proton and neutron to form a deuteron p n D . 15 For the present calculation we will take the input neutron abundance to be a \ufb01xed initial condition, which is a reasonable assumption given that the freeze out neutron abundance is set in place before deuterium synthesis begins see Fig. 2 . Note again that the deuterium reaction has exactly the same form as the recombination photoionization reaction p e H . 16 In that context, we derived the Saha equation nH npne 2 2 mekBT 3 2 exp BH kBT , 17 which states that neutral hydrogen is favored in the limitkBT ! 0, whereas ionized hydrogen is favored in the limitkBT !1 . In analogy with our procedure for recombination, the assumption of chemical equilibrium for deuterium \u00b5p \u00b5n \u00b5D, 18 1The exact same calculation that you performed in the homework applies to neutrinos, implying\u00b5 kBT n n n . However, since the relic neutrino background has not been directly detected we cannot use the charge neutrality argument to estimate the di erence in the numbers of particles to anti particles as we did for the electron. So we are implicitly assuming that similar to the small Baryon numbernB n B the universe also has a small lepton number and thus n n n 1. 6 implies the relative numbers of free protons, free neutrons, and deuterons are given by a completely analogous equation nD npnn gD gngp mD mpmn 3 2 2 2 kBT 3 2 exp mp mn mD c2 kBT 6 2 mnkBT 3 2 exp BD kBT , 19 where in the last equality we used the de\ufb01nition of the binding energy of deuterium BD mp mn mD c2 2 .22 MeV, 20 plugged in the degeneracy factor for the deuteron spin 1,gD 3 ,t h ep r o t o na n dn e u t r o n gp gn 2 ,a n da g a i nu s e dt h ea p p r o x i m a t i o nmp mn mD 2i nt h em a s sr a t i oi n the pre factor. Thus we end up with an equation equivalent to the Saha equation which describes nuclear statistical equilibrium NSE . Similar to electron protons vs. atoms, we see that there should be no deuterium bound state in the limit ofkBT !1 ,b u t deuterium is favored in the limitkBT ! 0. Similar to our approach for recombination, let s obtain an estimate for the temperature Tnuc at which deuterium becomes favored. To do this we will de\ufb01ne the time of deuterium synthesis to be atnD nB 1, when the deuterium abundance is a number of order unity. In the next section we will learn that the freeze out neutron abundance when neutrons decouple before deuterium synthesis is nn nB 1 6 or np 0 .83nB 21 and even today 75 of all baryons in the universe are in the form of unbound protons. So we can approximiately takenn nB 6a n dnp nB which gives nD nB nB 2 mpkBT 3 2 exp BD kBT , 22 where we substitutedmnc2 mpc2 9 3 8.3 MeV. Similar to our approach for recombination we can express the baryon density in terms of the baryon to photon ratio nB n 2 kBT 3 3 2 3c3 , 23 and we \ufb01nally obtain XD nD nB kBT mpc2 3 2 exp BD kBT , 24 Not surprisingly, this equation has the exact same form as our equation for the ionized fraction Xe during recombination. As long asBD T is not too large, the pre factor dominates this expression. Recall that this pre factor is extremely small becuase of the small 5.5 10 10 baryon to photon ratio. As the temperature drops, bound states like deuterium or neutral atoms become 7 energetically favored. We can solve for the temperatuerTnuc at whichXD 1b yt a k i n gt h e natural log of both sides kBTnuc BD ln 1 1 .5l n mpc2 kBT . 25 Solving this equation we \ufb01nd kBTnuc 0.07 MeV BD 34. 26 The reason whykBTnuc is a factor of 30 lower than the binding energy is again because of the extremely large number of photons to baryons, which can be seen in the equation above. Indeed, the temperature is only logarithimically sensitive to ,b u tb e c a u s e is so small this nevertheless has a signi\ufb01cant e ect on the temperature at which we can form deuterium. Just like in the case of recombination, the interpretation is that because photons outnumber baryons by such a gigantic factor, there are many high energy photons than can immediately destroy nuclei that are formed when the temperature is around the binding energy. In order for it to be energetically favorable to form bound states like deuterium, we need to lower the temperature enough such that even the photons in the high energy tail of the distribution are not abundant enough to inhibit deuterium production. This is what is known as thedeuterium bottleneck.A t o m i c n u c l e i a r e b u i l t u p s e q u e n t i a l l y from lighter elements via two body reactions. This implies that helium nuclei cannot be formed directly from neutrons and protons, because the densities are too low and the time available is too short for reactions involving three or more incoming nuclei to occur at an appreciable rate. The small baryon to photon ratio inhibits the production of deuterium until the temperature drops well beneath its nuclear binding energy. At temperatures above 0.1 MeV, then, virtually all baryons are in the form of neutrons and protons. Around this time, deuterium and then immediately helium are produced, but the reaction rates are by this time too low to produce any heavier elements. We will come back to this point when we discuss full non equilibrium solutions. 2.3 General Treatment Given a nuclear species with mass numberA n p and chargeZ p,w h e r en n u m b e r of neutrons andp number of protons in the nucleus, its equilibrium number density is given by nA gA mAkBT 2 2 3 2 exp \u00b5A mA T . 27 If nuclear reactions occur at a rate higher than the expansion rateH,t h e nc h e m i c a le q u i l i b rium is obtained. Although the weak force can convert protons into neutrons and vice versa, the total number of baryons is conserved in all of the interactions we will be concerned with here. This allows us to relate the chemical potential for the nucleus to that of protons and neutrons through \u00b5A Z\u00b5p A Z \u00b5n . 28 8 We can divide eqn. 28 byT and exponentiate to obtain exp \u00b5A kBT e x p Z\u00b5p A Z \u00b5n kBT nZ p nA Z n 2 2 mBkBT 3A 2 2 A exp Zmp A Z mn kBT , 29 where we in the pre factor we have introduced the nucleon or baryon massmB mp mn mA A.

The binding energies for the \ufb01rst few light elements are listed in Table 2. Note that the equi librium abundances of all bound nuclei are negligible as long as free neutrons and protons are in equilibrium due to the small factor. Figure 3 The NSE mass fractions of all nuclear species withZ 6, for a neutron to proton ratio of 0.14. If the universe had expanded arbitrarily slowly, allowing all nuclear processes to reach equilibrium, then the vast majority of the protons and neutrons would become bound into helium 4 nuclei, and later into carbon 12. Figure from Hooper. 10 By taking the natural log of the general expression forXA in eqn. 32 , we \ufb01nd that theXA will be of order unity at temperatures satisfying Tnuc BA A 1 ln 1 1 .5l n mpc2 kBT , 35 which is the generalization of eqn. 35 for deuterium. We see that NSE predicts that Tnuc 0 .07 MeV for deuterium,Tnuc 0 .11 MeV for3He, Tnuc 0 .28 MeV for4He, and Tnuc 0 .25 MeV for12C. These values are listed in Table 2. For the sake of illustration, consider the following system of light elements withZ 6 neutrons, protons, deuterons, tritium, 3He nuclei, 4He nuclei, and the istopes of C,12C, 13C, and 14C nuclei. A solution to the NSE system of equations in eqn. 34 is shown in Fig. 3. We can clearly see that although the binding energies per nucleon are of the order of 1 to 8 MeV see Table 2 , the equilibrium abundance of nuclear species does not become of order unity until a temperature of order 0.3 MeV. This is due to the high entropy of the Universe, that is, the very small value of . Although for temperatures less than a few MeV nuclei are favored on energetic grounds, entropy considerations i.e. the extremely small baryon to photon ratio favor free nucleons, and the entropy of the Universe is very high. Another important thing to note from this simple example and eqn. 32 is that in NSE the most bound heavy elements are favored as the temperature is decreased which would be late times . This simple illustrative calculation was cuto at CarbonZ 6 ,a n dw es e et h a t if the universe had expanded arbitrarily slowly, allowing all nuclear processes adequate time to reach equilibrium, then the vast majority of the protons and neutrons would \ufb01rst become bound into helium 4 nuclei, and later into carbon 12. These two isotopes each stand out in part because of their high binding energies per nucleon see Table 2 and Fig. 1 . Had we extended this calculation to heavier elements we would \ufb01nd that they dominate at progressively later times. Indeed, NSE predicts that the end state of the nulceosynthesis should be that all the material in the Universe should be in some iron nickel alloy, since these are the most bound heavy elements from Fig. 1. The reason why fortunately! , this did not occur in reality is that the Universe departs from NSE. The important thing to note is that NSE knows nothing about reaction rates or our criteria H. When we assume NSE, we assume that the Universe has enough time to arrive at thermal and chemical equilbrium, and the relative abundances of states simply depend on their relative energies and the relative numbers of particles e.g. photons to baryons . In the next section, we consider the non equilibrium calculation that is required to determine the freeze out abundance of neutrons. 3 Neutron Freeze Out In this section we want to solve for the non equilibrium neutron proton ratio that constitutes the initial conditions for BBN. As we see in eqns. 10 weak interactions convert protons into neutrons, and these reactions stay in equilibrium atT 3M e V . A t l a t e r t i m e s l o w e r temperatures one must use the Boltzmann equation to track the neutron abundance.

The \ufb01rst nucleus to form is therefore deuterium n p D . 56 Only when there is enough deuterium can the production of helium in signi\ufb01cant numbers commence via reactions like D p 3He D 3He 4He p 57 Because of thedeuterium bottleneck,w h i c hi st os a yt h a td e u t e r i u mp r o d u c t i o ni sd e l a y e d until Tnuc 0.07 MeV t 2 7 0 s ,h e l i u mp r o d u c t i o nt h u sh a st ow a i tf o rd e u t e r i u m . S i n c e the binding energy of helium is larger than that of deuterium see Table 2 , the Boltzmann factor eB kBT see eqn. 32 favors helium over deuterium. Indeed, in Fig. 2 we see that helium is produced almost immediately after deuterium begins to form. Thus virtually all of the remaining neutrons atT Tnuc t tnuc a r ep r o c e s s e di n t o4He.

Why wasn t12C or other heavy elements synthesized in the Big Bang like a naive NSE calculation see Fig. 3 might suggest? The answer is threefold Deuterium bottleneck The extremely small baryon to photon ratio implies that waiting for deuterium production delays the formation of the \ufb01rst nuclei toTnuc 0.07 MeV. By this time the two body reaction rates are too low to produce any heavier elements in signi\ufb01cant numbers. Helium is exceptionally tightly boundInspection of Fig. 1 illustrates that4He constitutes a local maximum in the binding energy per nucleon. Recall that the Boltz 16 mann factor eB kBT determines which bound states are preferred. The large binding energy of Helium means it can stick around as the preferred bound state for a long time e ectively terminiating BBN, because by the time the universe would be cool enough to prefer more tightly bound states the reaction rates are already too low and everything is frozen out. Lack of a stable istopesGlancing at Fig. 1 we see that there are no stable isotopes with atomic numberA 5o r A 8 . E x o t i ci s o t o p e sl i k e5He, 5Li, or 8Be are wildly unstable with extremely short half lives. This means once 4He is created, heavier elements cannot be produced via a reaction like 4He p !5 X. 59 What about the fusion of two or more4He nuclei? In massive stars, with core tem peratures above 0.01 MeV, helium can fuse into carbon via the so called triple alpha process 4He 4He !8 Be 60 followed by 8Be 4He ! 12C 2 . 61 The fact that8Be is unstable with a very short lifetime, however, makes this process very slow. It is e ective over the lifetime of a star, but not within the few minutes available for BBN. More generally, the lack of any stable nuclei withA 5o r A 8 and the fact that densities are too low and time available too short set by the Hubble expansion to allow three nuclei to \ufb01nd one another implies heavier elements are not created in signi\ufb01cant numbers. 5 Observations and Constraints on the Standard Model 5.1 Observations of Primordial Abundances The challenge of using observations to compare with BBN is that the early universe is not the only place where the number of elements are changed nucleosynthesis in stars forms heavy elements and can burn up primordial light elements. Nonetheless we can often tell when this is a problem, because heavy elements are only produced in signi\ufb01cant numbers in stars, so places where we see many heavy elements are clearly contaminated. Instead constraints can be placed by looking for low metallicity systems those with few heavy elements so that the observed abundances may better re\ufb02ect the primordial abundances metals in astrophysics are all the elements except hydrogen and helium . If the metallicity dependence of the abundance of interest can be judged, it may also be possible to extrapolate from observations to zero metallicity, even though we see no entirely uncontaminated systems. Deuterium M e a s u r e m e n t s o f t h e p r i m o r d i a l d e u t e r i u m a b u n d a n c e a r e p e r h a p s o u r single most powerful probe of the universe during its \ufb01rst few minutes. A major challenge in these determinations is the small binding energy of deuterium, which 17 makes it easily destroyed in stars. Strictly speaking, this means that any measurement of D H is technically a lower limit on the primordial abundance. This can be remedied by measuring the deuterium abundance in regions devoid of metals and hence with little evidence of destruction by stellar nucleosynthesis. For this we rely on observations of high redshift i.e. very early environments. In this regard, damped Lyman systems are particularly useful. Damped Lyman systems are dense regions in high redshift galaxies, for which it is possible to use precision spectroscopy to measure the hydrogen and deuterium column densities. At present, only a handful of such measurements have been made, but these have been used to precisely determine e.g. arXiv 1710.11129 D H p 2 .527 0.030 10 5 w h e r et h ep subscript indicates we are referring to the primordial value of this ratio. The measured value of this quantity doesn t show any correlation with redshift or metallicity a measure of past star formation , supporting the conclusion that these measurements re\ufb02ect the true primordial value. In contrast, measurements of the relative deuterium abundance in the Solar System and in the Milky Way show considerable variation, which is anti correlated with the presence of metals, indicative of the impact of stellar processing. Helium 4 This is a very strongly bound nucleus, so it is not destroyed by stellar processes, but is produced in stars together with other elements the observed abun dance should be larger than the primordial one.

These mea surements reveal a correlation between the4He abundance and the presence of metals in the system, indicating contamination of helium produced through fusion in stars. Extrapolating this relationship to zero metallicity results in a determination from arXiv 1112.3713 YP 0 .253 0.01 which compares well with the BBN prediction of around 0.248 for Planck baryon density parameters. Helium 3 Determinations of the primordial abundance of helium 3 have proven dif \ufb01cult. Measurements of3He have been made in the Solar System and the interstellar stellar medium, each indicating3H H 1.1 0.2 10 5.T h a t b e i n g s a i d ,3He is both destroyed and created in stars at relevant rates, making it unclear whether these mea surements are truly indicative of the primordial value. For this reason, most modern BBN analyses do not make use of any measurements of3He.

Such measurements have been used to determine Li H p 1 .6 0.3 10 10 Although this ratio represents the combined abundance of both 7Li and 6Li, the contribution from6Li is expected to be smaller than that of 7Li by a factor of 10 5.T h e o b s e r v e d r e l a t i o n s h i p b e t w e e n t h i s q u a n t i t y a n d s t e l l a r metallicity has raised questions about whether the lithium abundance might be de pleted in stars with moderate metallicities.

The other measurements then provide a highly non trivial consistency check on BBN predictions. They also constrain the number of additional light neutrinos or any other contribution to the energy densities at very high redshifts that would have changed the expansion rate during BBN. The value of that is observed, giving b 0.05, is broadly consistent with independent measurements at a redshift ofz 1100 from the anisotropies in the CMB. Once b or is \ufb01xed, we can then test observations of other abundances against the BBN predictions. These are broadly consistent for deuterium and helium 4. For lithium, observations suggest lithium is present at the order of magnitude predicted by BBN, but in detail signi\ufb01cantly less is observed than we d expect this is sometimes called the lithium problem see e.g. arXiv 1203.3551 .

The predicted abundances of light elements in BBN as a function of or equivalently B are plotted in Fig. 6 from a numerical code that evolves the full hierarchy of interaction equations . The fact that we \ufb01nd reasonably good quantitative agreement with observations is one of the great triumphs of the Big Bang model. 5.2 BBN Predctions and Testing the Standard Model The primordial abundances of light elements depends on the following parameters Neutron lifetime which is used to express the rate of the weak interactions. Nowa days, this is pretty well known. If n were larger, for example, then we would have a smaller interaction rate, which would imply a larger neutron freeze out temperature and larger neutron to proton ratio, and therefore a larger4He abundance. Baryon to photon ratio T h e m a s s f r a c t i o n f o r t h e n u c l e a r s p e c i e s i s p r o p o r t i o n a l to this parameter, so the smaller is, the smallerXA photon destruction of formed nuclei remains e ective until lower temperatures when there are more photons per baryon . A higher means that the mass fractions for the deuterium, tritium and3He build up earlier, so that the synthesis of4He is more e cient, we get more helium and less is left of the lighter nuclei. This number can be constrained both from comparison of BBN predictions with data, and also independently through the detailed shape of the spectrum of anisotropies in the CMB.

Therefore, the Universe will be younger at a given temperature, i.e. the pre factor in eqn. 53 would be smaller. This means that the time between 20 the temperature when neutrinos freeze out and the temperatureTnuc when deuterium starts forming would be shorter, and there would thus be less time for neutrons to decay see e.g. eqn. 54 . The neutron to proton ratio is therefore larger at the on set of nucleosynthesis and so is the \ufb01nal primordial helium abundance. Observations constrain the extra number of neutrino families to be less than one. 21",

In its full generality this is a very complex and technical task. There are several reasons for this complexity. First, the di\ufb00erential equations that describe structure formation are non linear which means that they will not admit simple analytical solutions, and furthermore the systems evolve chaotically. The remedy for this is straighforward one can always resort to numerical calulations. Non linear evolution is however unfortunately not the only complication. To fully solve for the evolution of structure Newtonian gravity will not su\ufb03ce, and one needs to use the full machinery of general relativity. There are several reasons for this. The \ufb01rst is that, as we learned beore, all forms of mass energy can gravitate, and so to properly treat \ufb02uctuations in the relativistic components we need GR. Even more subtle and complicated are issues related to causality and the presence of horizons, which clearly requires GR since Newtonian gravity would imply action at a distance. Although Newtonian analysis provides valuable insight into the behavior of inhomogeneities, it su\ufb00ers from the following di\ufb03culty. As we will learn, at su\ufb03ciently early epochs the wavelengths \u03bb of density \ufb02uctuation modes that we will need to consider will lie outside of the particle horizon rph. Newtonian analysis is only valid for later times when wavelength of the \ufb02uctuations are much smaller than the particle horizon \u03bb rph. Thus the early evolution of any mode needs to be tackled using the full machinery in GR. One of the main challenges with studying the growth of inhomogenities in GR is the question of gauge freedom. Qualitatively, you can think of the choice of a gauge as choosing a coordinate system. For modes much smaller than the horizon, there exists a natural choice of coordinates in which GR looks like Newtonian gravity, adhering to our physical intuition. However, for super horizon modes this is not the case, and for technical reasons one cannot work in this quasi Newtonian gauge. These gauge coordinate ambiguities make the full treatment in GR a rather daunting task. The full GR treatment is thus beyond the scope of this course. In this set of lectures we will restrict attention to the Newtonian treatment in the linear regime \u03b4 x 1, which allows us to linearize the di\ufb00erential equations, allowing us to obtain analytical results in a few cases. In a future lecture, we will discuss evolution of density \ufb02uctuations in the non linear regime. 1 Jeans Instability Before treating an expanding universe, let s start by building our intuition by studying the growth of preturbations due to gravitational instability in a static nonexpanding uni verse. Thus we consider a homogenous isotropic background density of matter with time 1 independent density \u03c10 r,t const. The evolution equations for a perfect \ufb02uid are \u03c1 t \u03c1v 0 continuity 1 v t v v P \u03c1 \u03a6 Euler 2 2\u03a6 4\u03c0G\u03c1 Poisson . 3 These equations express conservation of mass energy continuity , conservation of momen trum Euler , and gravity Poisson , respectively. They amount to \ufb01ve equations in six unknowns \u03c1, v, P, \u03a6 , so they must be supplemented by another equation. Similar to our derivation of the Friedmann equation, we must supplement these equations with an equation of state P P \u03c1 . Actually the most general form would be to assume P P \u03c1,S , where S is the entropy, but we will assume the entropy is \ufb01xed, \u03b4S 0, which is to say we will only consider isentropic perturbations 1 . We consider small preturbations about a homogenous solution \u03c1 r,t \u03c10 \u03b4\u03c1 r,t P r,t P0 \u03b4P r,t v r,t v0 \u03b4v \u03b4v r,t \u03a6 r,t \u03a60 \u03b4\u03a6 r,t , 4 where the terms with zero subscript are constants, we have assumed v0 0, and \u03b4\u03c1 \u03c10, etc. Using the equation of state, the pressure perturbation can be written \u03b4P c2 s\u03b4\u03c1, c 2 s P \u03c1 S 5 where cs is the sound speed. Note that as constructed this set of equations has some serious problems. If the \ufb02uid is to remain homogenous with constant density \u03c1 then we must also have F \u03a60 0, or else there would be a net gravitational force. But this implies that 2\u03a60 4\u03c0G\u03c10 0 as well, so the gas is not actually there! This means that there can be no homogenous self gravitating \ufb02uid in equilibrium. For now we will simply ignore this complication and assume that such a solution with 2\u03a60 4\u03c0G\u03c10 does exist, since it turns out to give a useful physical picture anyway. This is what is commonly referred to as the Jeans swindle. Substituting eqns. 4 into the continuity equation eqn. 1 and gathering terms that are 1Entropy perturbations can occur only in multi component \ufb02uids. For example, in a \ufb02uid consisting of baryons and radiation, the baryons can be distributed inhomogeneously on a homogeneous background of radiation. In such a case, the entropy, which is equal to the number of photons per baryon, varies from place to place. In general there are two types of perturbations isentropic perturbations for which \u03b4S 0 and \u03b4\u03c1 0 , and so called isocurvature pertubrations, which have \u03b4\u03c1 0 \u03b4S 0 . 2 zeroth, \ufb01rst, and second order in products of perturbed quantities gives \u03c10 t \u03c10v0 0th order \u03b4\u03c1 t \u03c10\u03b4v \u03b4\u03c1v0 1st order \u03b4\u03c1\u03b4v 2nd order . 6 Here the 0th order terms concern the homogenous unperturbed universe. In this static case they are trivially zero, since we have assumed a constant background, but in the future when we perturb about an expanding homogenous and isotropic background they will be satis\ufb01ed by the unperturbed zero subscript terms. Keeping only linear order in perurbed quantities, that is, ignoring the second order terms, we obtain for the perturbed continuity equation \u03b4\u03c1 t \u03c10 \u03b4v, 7 where we used the fact thatv0 0. Applying this same procedure to all of the \ufb02uid equations in eqns. 1 3 gives \u03b4\u03c1 t \u03c10 \u03b4v, continuity 8 \u03b4v t c2 s \u03c10 \u03b4\u03c1 \u03b4\u03a6 Euler 9 2\u03b4\u03a6 4\u03c0G\u03b4\u03c1. Poisson 10 Taking the divergence of eqn. 9 , and using the continuity eqn. 8 and Poisson eqn. 10 to express \u03b4v and 2\u03b4\u03a6 in terms of \u03b4\u03c1, we \ufb01nally obtain 2\u03b4\u03c1 t2 c2 s 2\u03b4\u03c1 4\u03c0G\u03c10\u03b4\u03c1 0. 11 This is a closed linear wave equation for the perurbed density \u03b4\u03c1. It has two driving terms 2\u03b4\u03c1 t2 4\u03c0G\u03c10\u03b4\u03c1 gravity c2 s 2\u03b4\u03c1 pressure , 12 which re\ufb02ect the competetition between gravitational forces that promote collapse, and pres sure forces which oppose collapse. Noting that the coe\ufb03cients in the equation above are constants which do not depend on position, we can thus express \u03b4\u03c1 in terms of its Fourier transform \u03b4\u03c1 r,t d3k 2\u03c0 3 \u03b4\u03c1 k,t eik r, 13 and plug into eqn. 11 to obtain a set of ordinary di\ufb00erential equations for the time dependent Fourier coe\ufb03cients \u03b4\u03c1 k,t \u03b4 \u03c1 k,t k2c2 s 4\u03c0G\u03c10 \u03b4\u03c1 k,t 0, 14 3 where dot denotes a time derivative with respect to time t, and k k . The equation above has two independent solutions \u03b4\u03c1 k,t exp i\u03c9 k t , 15 where \u03c9 k k2c2 s 4\u03c0G\u03c10. 16 The behavior of these isentropic perturbations depends crucially on the sign of the expression under the square root. We will de\ufb01ne the Jeans length as \u03bbJ 2\u03c0 kJ cs \u03c0 G\u03c10 1 2 , 17 such that \u03c9 kJ 0, we conclude that if \u03bb \u03bbJ k kJ , \u03c9 k is real and the solutions describe acoustic oscillations sound waves \u03b4\u03c1 k,t sin \u03c9t k r \u03b1 , 18 propagating with phase velocity cphase \u03c9 k k cs 1 k2 J k2 . 19 In the limit k kJ, that is on very small scales \u03bb \u03bbJ where gravity is negligible compared to the pressure, we have cphase cs, as should be the case. On large scales gravity dominates and if k kJ \u03bb \u03bb J , we have \u03c9 k is imaginary and \u03b4\u03c1 k,t exp \u03c9 t . 20 One of these solutions describes the exponentially fast growth of inhomogeneities, while the other corresponds to a decaying mode. When k 0, \u03c9 t t tgr where tgr 1 4\u03c0G\u03c10 . 21 We interpret tgr as the characteristic collapse time for a region with initial density \u03c10. Inspecting the de\ufb01nition of the Jeans length, we see that it is \u03bbJ cstgr, or the distance which sound waves can travel in a gravitational free fall time. It thus characterizes the maximum distance over which sound waves can communicate, allowing pressure forces to counteract changes in the density due to gravitational instability. For \ufb02uctuations larger than this maximum distance \u03bb \u03bbJ k kJ , pressure cannot react quickly enough and the mode is unstable to gravitational collapse. For shorter wavelengths, \u03bb \u03bbJ k kJ pressure can react, and a pressure gradient is created which then counteracts collapse and instead gives rise to acoustic oscillations. We thus see that for long wavelength modes \u03bb \u03bbJ, gravitational instability is extremely e\ufb03cient in a static universe. Small amplitude 4 perturbations will be exponentially ampli\ufb01ed on the gravitational free fall timescale tgr. 2 Gravitational Instability in an Expanding Universe 2.1 Background Homogenous Universe We will now work through the math for perturbation theory in an expanding universe. In an expanding homogenous and isotropic universe, the background energy density is a function of time, and the background velocities obey the Hubble law. At the beginning of the course we derived the Friedmann equations from Newtonian mechanics by considering a uniform expanding ball of \ufb02uid. Here we repeat this analysis but now from the perspective of the \ufb02uid equations. Without perturbations we have \u03c1 \u03c10 t and v v0 H t r. 22 Plugging these into the continuity equation \u03c1 t \u03c1v 0 \u03c10 t t \u03c10 t H t r \u03c10 t t 3\u03c10 t H t 0. 23 This just states that the total mass energy of non relativistic matter is conserved. This is equivalent to the energy equation we derived for an FRW universe \u03c1 3H \u03c1 P c2 0, for the case of P \u03c1c2, i.e. in the Newtonian limit of a non relativistic \ufb02uid. Now consider the Poisson equation 2\u03a6 4 \u03c0G\u03c1. Taking \u03a6 0 at r 0, the Poisson equation integrates as r r2 \u03a6 r 4\u03c0G\u03c10 r2 24 \u03a6 r 1 3 4\u03c0G\u03c10 r 25 \u03a6 1 6 4\u03c0G\u03c10 r2 26 The Euler equation becomes v t v v P \u03c1 \u03a6 27 t H t r H t r H t r P \u03c10 \u03a6 28 Hr H2 r r r 4\u03c0G\u03c10 3 r 29 H H2 4\u03c0G\u03c10 3 , 30 5 where we used eqn. 26 above for \u03c6 and assumed P 0, since P P \u03c1 and we are assuming a homogenous universe with \u03c1 \u03c10 t so there there are no pressure gradients. But note that H d dt a a a a H2 H H2 a a, 31 but recalling the acceleration equation a a 4\u03c0G 3 \u03c1 3P c2 32 we see that the acceleration equation implies H H2 4\u03c0G 3 \u03c1 3P c2 . 33 Thus comparing the equation above, derived from the acceleration equation, to the result of applying the Euler equation to the background model in eqn. 30 , we see that they are equivalent if \u03c1 3P c2 \u03c1, or P \u03c1c2, which is again true in the Newtonian limit of a non relativistic \ufb02uid. Or equivalently, GR states that the source of gravity is not \u03c1 but rather \u03c1 3P c2. 2.2 Perturbed Expanding Universe Again considering isentropic perturbations i.e. ignoring entropy perturbations so that \u03b4S 0 we now proceed analgously to the static universe case and perturb about the expanding universe \u03c1 r,t \u03c10 t \u03b4\u03c1 r,t P r,t P0 \u03b4P r,t P0 c2 s\u03b4\u03c1 r,t v r,t H t r \u03b4v r,t 34 \u03a6 r,t \u03a60 r,t \u03b4\u03a6 r,t . 35 Plugging these expressions into the \ufb02uid eqns. 1 3 , using the results for the background terms from the previous subsection, and keeping only terms up to linear order we \ufb01nally obtain \u03b4\u03c1 t \u03c10 \u03b4v \u03b4\u03c1v0 0 Continuity 36 \u03b4v t v0 \u03b4v \u03b4v v0 c2 s \u03c10 \u03b4\u03c1 \u03b4\u03a6 0 Euler 37 2\u03b4\u03a6 4\u03c0G\u03b4\u03c1 Poisson 38 Note that the Hubble velocity v0 depends explicitly on r and therefore taking the Fourier transform with respect to these Eulerian coordinates r does not reduce these equations to a simple decoupled set of ordinary di\ufb00erential equations for the Fourier modes \u03b4\u03c1 k as before. For this reason it is more convenient to work with so called Lagrangian coordinates x which 6 are comoving with the Hubble \ufb02ow , which are related to the Eulerian coordinates via r a t x, 39 where a t is the scale factor. However, with this new choice of coordinates we have to work out how the derivatives in the equations above transform. For example, the partial derivative with respect to time taken at constant r is di\ufb00erent from the partial derivative with respect to time taken at constant x. Consider a general function f r,t , which we want to express at f r a t x,t . We can write df f t x dt f x t dx f t r dt f r t dr. 40 But note that dr x adt a t dx v0dt a t dx, 41 where the last equality used v0 dr dt ax H t r. 42 Thus our equation for dfabove becomes df f t x dt f x t dx f t r dt f r t v0dt a t dx f t r v0 f r t dt a t f r t dx. 43 Thus gathering terms we conclude t r t x v0 r 44 r 1 a x. 45 Replacing the derviatives in eqns. 38 and introducing the fractional amplitude of the density pertubrations \u03b4 \u03b4\u03c1 \u03c10, we \ufb01nally obtain \u03b4 t 1 a \u03b4v 0 Continuity 46 \u03b4v t H\u03b4v c2 s a \u03b4 1 a \u03b4\u03a6 0 Euler 47 2\u03b4\u03a6 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c10\u03b4 Poisson , 48 where now x, 2 2 x are all derivatives with respect to the Lagrangian coordinates x, and the time partial derivatives are taken at constant x. In deriving the equations above, we used that r v0 3H and \u03b4v r v0 H\u03b4v. Finally, we can take the divergence of the Euler eqn. 47 and using the continuity and Poisson equations to express \u03b4v and 2\u03c6 in terms of \u03b4, we derive the closed form equation which describes gravitational instability in 7 an expanding universe \u03b4 2H \u03b4 c2 s a2 2\u03b4 4\u03c0G\u03c10\u03b4 0. 49 Let s brie\ufb02y discuss the terms that appear in this equation \u03b4 2 H \u03b4 Hubble Drag 4\u03c0G\u03c10\u03b4 gravity c2 s a2 2\u03b4 pressure . 50 The right hand side has two source terms which are familiar from our study of Jeans in stability in a static universe, namely a gravitational term which promotes collapse, and a pressure term which opposes collapse. There is however now a new Hubble Drag term which encodes the fact that the expansion of the universe acts like a friction term opposing the acceleration of gravitational instability. 2.3 Solution for an Einstein De Sitter Universe We observe that now in Lagrangian or comoving coordinates, the terms in eqn. 49 have coe\ufb03cients which are independent of the spatial coordinates x, allowing us to perform a Fourier decomposition of the overdensity \ufb01eld \u03b4 x \u03b4 x,t d3k 2\u03c0 3 \u03b4 k,t eik x. 51 Plugging this expression into eqn. 49 and noting ik, we obtain an ordinary di\ufb00erential equation for each independent Fourier mode \u03b4k 2H \u03b4k \u03b4k 4\u03c0G\u03c10 c2 sk2 a2 , 52 where we have abbreviated \u03b4 k,t with \u03b4k. Note that since we are working in comoving coordinates x, the wavenumbers k in eqn. 51 and the equation above are all comoving wavenumbers which correspond to \ufb02uctuations with wavelength \u03bb 2\u03c0 k which is also a comoving wavelength. If we consider the limit H 0 and a t 1, i.e. a static universe, we recover eqn. 14 that we derived in 1 for a static homogenous universe \u03b4k \u03b4k c2 sk2 4\u03c0G\u03c10 . 53 The di\ufb00erence now is that we are dealing with comoving wavenumbers k, and that there is an extra Hubble drag term 2 H \u03b4k that slows down the growth relative to the static case which we will discuss momentarily. Based on what we learned in the static universe, we know that the behavior of a perturbation depends crucially on its spatial size, where the critical lengthscale which separates acoustic oscillations from gravitational instability is the 8 Jeans scale \u03bbJ 2\u03c0a kJ cs \u03c0 G\u03c10 1 2 . 54 Note that the Jeans scale here is a proper wavelength, which explains the presence of the scale factor in eqn. 54 above, which converts the comoving wavelength \u03bbcom J 2\u03c0 kJ to a proper wavelength via \u03bbJ a\u03bbcom J . Consider a \ufb02at, matter dominated universe, also known as an Einstein de Sitter Universe. The Friedmann equation states H2 t 8\u03c0G 3 \u03c10 t , 55 and since \u03c1 a 3 we saw previously that a t2 3 H 2 3t \u03c10 t 1 6\u03c0Gt2 , 56 which implies \u03bbJ 6\u03c0cst cst, 57 that is, the Jeans length is comparable to the sound horizon , which is the proper distance that a sound wave can travel over the age of the Universe. Thus analgous to the static case we \ufb01nd that the Jeans scale can be thought of as the sound communication time or the distance that a sound wave can travel in a gravitaional free fall time which is also equal to the expansion time H 1 in an expanding universe. Perturbations on scales much smaller than the Jeans scale \u03bb \u03bbJ are oscillatory acoustic waves, whereas on scales much larger than the Jeans scale \u03bb \u03bbJ , gravity will dominate leading to collapse. But now owing to the expansion of the Universe, \u03bbJ changes with time so a given perturbation may switch between periods of growth and stasis acoustic oscillations . We will see that these e\ufb00ects govern the perturbation spectrum that has propagated into the present universe from early times. We will return to acoustic oscillations shortly, for the moment let us focus on scales \u03bb \u03bbJ or k kJ such that we can igore the c2 sk2 a2 relative to the gravitational driving term 4 \u03c0G\u03c10 in eqn. 52 . For a \ufb02at matter dominated universe, using the expressions in eqn. 56 for H t and \u03c10 t eqn. 52 simpli\ufb01es to \u03b4 2H \u03b4 \u03b4 4\u03c0G\u03c10 c2 sk2 a2 4\u03c0G\u03c10\u03b4 58 \u03b4 4 3t \u03b4 2 3t2 \u03b4 0, where for simplicity we write \u03b4 to mean \u03b4k. If we guess that the solutions have a power law form \u03b4 Dtn, 59 9 plugging this guess into the equation above yields n n 1 Dtn 2 4 3tnDtn 1 2 3t2 Dtn 0 n n 1 4 3n 2 3 0. 60 The two possible solutions to the quadratic equation above are n 1 and n 2 3. Thus the general solution for the time evolution of large scale \u03bb \u03bbJ density perturbtations in a \ufb02at matter dominated universe is \u03b4 D1t2 3 D2t 1, 61 wwhere the values of D1 and D2 are determined by the initial conditions for \u03b4 t . The decaying mode t 1 eventually becomes negligilbly small compared to the growing mode t2 3. Thus we see that once the growing mode dominates, the density of perturbations grows at the rate \u03b4 t2 3 a t 1 1 z, 62 provided the linear approximation \u03b4 1 holds. In the important case of a \ufb02at, matter dominated universe, which is a good description of the universe at early times before \u039b takes over, the growing mode is proportional to the scale factor. Hence, we see that in an expanding universe, gravitational instability is much less e\ufb03cient. Whereas in the static universe \ufb02uctuations grow exponentially on the gravitational free fall timescale, we see here that instead the perturbation amplitude increases only as a power of time. 2.4 Comparison to the CMB Anisotropy Level CMB anisotropy measurements probe temperature \ufb02uctuations which result from \ufb02uctua tions in the radiation energy density \u03c1r T4, thus \u03b4\u03c1r \u03c1r 4\u03b4T T . 63 Planck measured the rms temperature \ufb02uctuation to be \u03b4T T 2 1 2 10 5 \u03b4\u03c1r \u03c1r 10 5 \u03b4b 10 5 64 where in the last equality we have assumed that \ufb02uctuations in the baryons must be compa rable to the radiation, since the baryons are tightly coupled to the radiation by Thompson scattering prior to decoupling. We just learned that in a matter dominated universe, which is a good description of the universe prior to very recently i.e. prior to zm\u039b 0.3 , that \ufb02uctuations larger than the Jeans scale \u03bbJ grow proportional to the scale factor, thus we expect \u03b4b t0 a t0 a tdec \u03b4b tdec 1 zdec \u03b4b tdec 1100 10 5 10 2. 65 10 But we observe highly nonlinear structures in the universe today, and speci\ufb01cally we know that even on relatively large comoving scales of 8 h 1 Mpc, approaching the smallest scales probed by the CMB \u03c3 R 8 h 1 Mpc 1, 66 which is a factor of one hundred larger than our estimate above. Where did we go wrong? Well there are a couple of important complications that we have ignored 1. Nature of the perturbed component. The universe is made up of collisionless dark matter cold, warm, hot? , baryons, and radiation. Our estimate above for the \ufb02uctuations from the CMB was based on using the CMB as a proxy for the baryonic component. The \ufb02uctuations in the underlying dark matter were much larger than 10 5 at decoupling explaining how we get large \u03c3 R 8 h 1 Mpc 1 today. This is actually one of the strongest pieces of evidence for dark matter. 2. Species which dominates the energy density The expansion of the universe pow ers the Hubble drag term in eqn. 50, which opposes gravitational instability. We saw that in the the matter dominated case expansion reduces the perturbation growth rate from exponential static universe to power law expanding universe . We thus expect that if other energy components radiation, dark energy dominate the expansion rate relative to the component experiencing gravitational collapse matter , that the growth of perturbations will slow down. 3 Coupled Perturbations If the energy density is comprised of a sum of contributions from di\ufb00erent components \u03c1 i \u03c1i, 67 where e.g. i baryons, dark matter, photons, neturinos, etc., then the equation describing the evolution of the perturbation \u03b4i in the non relativistic component i is \u03b4i 2H \u03b4i c2 sik2 a2 \u03b4i 4\u03c0G j \u03c1j\u03b4j non relativistic k 2\u03c1k\u03b4k relativistic . 68 Whereas the relativistic component obeys a slightly di\ufb00erent equation \u03b4i 2H \u03b4i c2k2 3a2 \u03b4i 4\u03c0G j 4 3\u03c1j\u03b4j non relativistic k 8 3\u03c1k\u03b4k relativistic . 69 These modi\ufb01cations can be derived using special relativistic \ufb02uid mechanics and Newtownian gravity. The sound speed for a relativistic \ufb02uid is cs c 3 follows from the fact that 11 P \u03c1c2 3, which explains the pressure term for the relativistic component. The factors of 2, 4 3, and 8 3 etc., come from the fact that pressure gravitates, and for a relativistic \ufb02uid the pressure P is comparable to the energy density \u03c1. 3.1 Matter and Radiation During Radiation Domination Let us now consider a multi component system of cold dark matter, baryons, and radiation during the era when the universe was radiation dominated. Radiation matter equality occurs prior to decoupling, and the baryons and the photons will be tightly coupled together in a photon baryon \ufb02uid with a sound speed that is very close to the speed of light, whereas the dark matter is an independent collisionless matter component which only interacts with the photon baryon \ufb02uid gravitationally. The main point to note is that the \ufb02uctuations in this photon baryon \ufb02uid should be very small inside of the horizon, in other words, according to eqn. 69 below \u03bbJ cH 1. Sub Jeans radiation \ufb02uctuations therefore oscillate as sound waves and their time averaged density contrast vanishes. To describe these \ufb02uctuations on the horizon scale properly GR is actually required. As such, typically when using the Newtonian equations above, one restricts attention to scales well within the horizon \u03bb cH 1. This means we can can assume the relativistic components have zero \ufb02uctuations \u03b4i 0. In this limit the equation describing the CDM \ufb02uctuations \u03b4c becomes \u03b4c 2H \u03b4c 4\u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c, 70 where the c2 sk2 a2 term now vanishes because CDM is a collisionless matter component which does not experience pressure forces i.e. cs 0 . This equation is identical to eqn. 58 except that now we are not matter dominated. When the universe is radiation dominated H 1 2t H2 8\u03c0G 3 \u03c1r \u03c1c 8\u03c0G\u03c1r 3 , 71 where in the last equality we assumed \u03c1r \u03c1c since we are radiation dominated. Note also that the \ufb01rst two terms in eqn. 70 \u03b4c 2H \u03b4c H2\u03b4c 72 since the only timescale in the problem is the Hubble time if pressure forces were relevant the other relevant timescale would be the sound crossing time \u03bb cs, but we have assumed collisionless dark matter . But since 4\u03c0G\u03c1c 4\u03c0G\u03c1r H2, 73 we can neglect the term on the right hand side of eqn. 70 relative to the other two terms. In other words \u03b4c 1 t \u03b4c 0., 74 The solution to this equation is \u03b4c t \u03b4c ti 1 Aln t ti , 75 12 thus only a solution with an initial velocity , \u03b4 ti 0, can actually grow so that A 0 , and only logarithmically at that. This suppression of the growth of \ufb02uctuations on scales inside the photon baryon \ufb02uid sound horizon during radiation domination is known as the Meszaros e\ufb00ect. It says that, at early times, the dominant energy of radiation drives the universe to expand so fast that the collisionless matter, whose gravity is sub dominant, has no time to respond, and \u03b4 grows at most only logarithmically. At late times, the radiation eventually becomes negligible, and the growth of perturbations increases smoothly to the Einstein de Sitter \u03b4 a t behavior that we derived earlier. 3.2 Late Time Suppression of Structure Formation by \u039b Analogous to the Meszaros e\ufb00ect is a similar suppression of perurbation growth at late times when the Universe becomes cosmological constant dominated. Indeed, this is more relevant to the future since we showed that the epoch of matter \u039b equality is zm\u039b 0.3. In this limit the equation governing CDM perturbations is \u03b4c 2H\u039b \u03b4c 0, 76 where the Hubble parameter has the constant value H H\u039b and we have assumed that we are dark energy dominated 4\u03c0G\u03c1c 4\u03c0G\u03c1\u039b H2 \u039b. 77 This equation has solutions of the form \u03b4c t C1 C2e 2H\u039bt, 78 thus we see that \u039b suppresses the growth of structure. There is only a decaying mode, and a constant mode, but not a growing mode. As such, the \ufb02uctuations in the matter density reach a constant fractional amplitude. We have thus seen how linear perturbations grow when the universe is Einstein De Sitter and \u039b dominated. In general, we write the growing mode solution as \u03b4c t D a , 79 where D a is the linear growth function, which has to be solved for numerically. 3.3 Baryons and DM Before and After Decoupling Now let s consider this same mix of photons, baryons, and CDM but after matter radiation equality when the Universe is matter dominated. But now let s consider the \ufb02uctuations in the photon baryon \ufb02uid. The equations governing these coupled perturbations are \u03b4c 2H \u03b4c 4 \u03c0G \u03c1c\u03b4c \u03c1b\u03b4b 4\u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c 80 \u03b4b 2H \u03b4b c2 sk2 a2 4\u03c0G \u03c1c\u03b4c \u03c1b\u03b4b c2 sk2 a2 4\u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c, 81 13 where in the last equality we have assumed that the dark matter dominates the matter content. Since the dark matter dominates the gravity and the expansion rate, and we are Einstein de Sitter and matter dominated, eqn. 80 for the dark matter yields the growing solution \u03b4 a t which we studied before. Thus the 4 \u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c in the baryon evolution equation can be thought of as an external driving term. Given the pressure term in the evolution equation for the baryons and the fact that the Jeans scale \u03bbJ csH 1 cH 1 is comparable to the horizon size, nearly all modes inside the horizon have k kJ \u03bb \u03bbJ . Thus the high sound speed causes the baryons to evolve di\ufb00erently than the dark matter, namely the baryons will experience slowly declining sound waves \u03b4b 1 acs 1 2 exp ik csdt a t . 82 These are the acoustic oscillations that give rise to the peaks in the CMB and the baryon acoustic oscillation signature in the dark matter power spectrum via the small back reaction of the baryons on the dark matter, which we have above ignored . Since some of the these are large scale horizon size modes, and since the baryons and photons are tightly coupled into a single \ufb02uid, typically one resorts to GR to solve this problem correctly. Now let s examine what happens after decoupling. As you will show in the homework, the sound speed of the baryons drops precipitously, and now the Jeans scale of the baryons is extremely small, about comparable to the mass of a globular cluster. We can thus now consider the coupled perturbations, but ignore the pressure term \u03b4c 2H \u03b4c 4\u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c 83 \u03b4b 2H \u03b4b 4\u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c. 84 We know that the solution for the dark matter growth has the solution \u03b4c constant a \u03b1a. 85 Substituting this result into eqn. 84 for the baryon evolution, we can write it as a3 2 d da 1 a1 2 d\u03b4b da 2d\u03b4b da 3 2\u03b1, 86 where we have assumed an Einstein de Sitter matter dominated universe with a t2 3. This equation has the growing solution \u03b4b \u03b1 a a0 \u03b4c a 1 C a , 87 where C is some constant. This solution thus shows that \u03b4b \u03b4c for a C, even if for example \u03b4b 0 at some a C adec. In other words, baryonic perturbations quickly catch up with dark matter preturbations after decoupling. This in turn allows us to understand how the \ufb02uctuations in the baryons can be so small \u03b4b T T 10 5 at decoupling, as implied by the CMB anisotropy level, but nevertheless grow to form large non linear 14 structures today. Whereas baryons are coupled to the photons prior to decoupling and thus have a horizon size Jeans scale gigantic Jeans mass , the dark matter only interacts gravitationally and \ufb02uctuations have been growing all along. 4 Understanding the Power Spectrum In\ufb02ation predicts a nearly scale invariant power spectrum which can be quanti\ufb01ed in terms of the rms \ufb02uctuations \u03c32 of the Newtonian graviational potential, in other words at some initial time ti when the \ufb02uctuations were put in place 2 \u03a6 k,ti d\u03c32 \u03a6 dln k k3 2\u03c02 P\u03a6 k,ti constant P\u03a6 k,ti k 3. 88 From the perturbed Poisson s equation 2\u03b4\u03a6 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c10\u03b4, so in Fourier space we get k2\u03b4\u03a6 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c10\u03b4 P\u03b4 k4P\u03a6 k P\u03b4 k k, 89 thus in\ufb02ation predicts P k kn with n 1. Comparing this to the matter power spectrum, we see that on large scales, k kpeak 0.06 Mpc 1, P k k as expected, but on small scales, k kpeak, P k k 3, seemingly violating the prediction from in\ufb02ation. How can we understand the shape of the power spectrum? 4.1 Super Horizon Growth of Perturbations Our treatment thus far has been purely Newtonian which is an action at a distance theory. As such it cannot deal with the fact that in an expanding spacetime there exist particle horizons that limit the distance between causally connected regions of the universe. In\ufb02ation creates perturbations on all scales including super horizon scales. Fluctuations that were generated during in\ufb02ation are constantly entering the horizon as the universe expands. This notion of super horizon \ufb02uctuations is necessary to understand the peak in the matter power spectrum, P k , and why it deviates from the scale invariant prediction from in\ufb02ationP k k on small scales. Only GR can properly treat the evolution of \ufb02uctuations comparable or greater than the horizon scale. This is beyond the scope of this course so we will instead proceed heuristically. First, let s review what we know about horizons. 4.1.1 Horizons Previously we showed that if the the energy density is dominated by a single energy compo nent with equation of state w such that the pressure is P w\u03c1c2, 90 then the \ufb02uid equation implies that \u03c1 a 3 1 w , 91 15 and the Friedmann equation ignoring curvature then reads H2 8\u03c0G\u03c1 3c2 aH 1 H 1 0 a 1 3w 2, 92 such that the comoving particle horizon is dph a t ti cdt a a ai da a a a ai aH 1dln a 2cH 1 0 1 3w a 1 3w 2 a 1 3w 2 i . 93 Previously we argued that in\ufb02ation causes the horizon to diverge solving the horizon problem. Here we are interested in understanding the evolution of density \ufb02uctuations that were put in place by in\ufb02ation, so ai is here some very small scale factor after in\ufb02ation. This implies the ai term in the equation above is basically zero, and we have dph a 2cH 1 0 1 3wa 1 3w 2. 94 The particle horizon is a comoving distance, but for the moment, let s consider the proper particle horizon at this scale factor a rph a adph a 2cH 1 0 1 3wa3 1 w 2 95 Note however that for this same model it is easy to show that 2H 1 0 3 1 w a3 1 w 2 t a t 2 3 1 w , 96 and thus we obtain the simple result rph t 1 w 3ct 1 3w . 97 For a matter dominated universe w 0 , rph t 3 ct, whereas for radiation domination w 1 3 , rph t 2ct. Thus the proper particle horizon is always of order rph t ct. Now consider how the proper size\u03bbprop of a perturbation with comoving wavelength\u03bbevolves with time. We know that \u03bbprop a t \u03bb, and given the scaling for a t implied by eqn. 96 we see that rph 2ct \u03bbprop a t \u03bb t1 2\u03bb radiation dominated rph 3ct \u03bbprop a t \u03bb t2 3\u03bb matter dominated . 98 Thus the proper size of a comoving perturbation \u03bb has a shallower time evolution than the proper particle horizon rph. This faster evolution of the horizon size means that modes which are initially outside of the horizon will at some time enter the horizon as the universe expands because the horizon grows faster and catches up with the proper scale. This is illustrated in 16 Fig. 1. Figure 1 A \ufb02uctuation which is superhorizon scale at matter radiation equality grows always, while a \ufb02uctuation which enters the horizon during the radiation dominated era stops growing in amplitude until the matter dominated era begins. Figure from Norman arxiv e print 1005.1100. 4.1.2 Sub Horizon Growth Rates The reason why this notion of horizon entry is so important is that modes evolve di\ufb00erently outside of the horizon than they do when they are inside the horizon. Let s \ufb01rst recap how sub horizon density perturbations grow and also consider how the gravitational potential evolves. We will restrict attention to the cold dark matter, which means we can ignore the e\ufb00ect of free streaming, which we will discuss next. From our perturbation theory analyses we learned that sub horizon modes grow as the scale factor during matter domination \u03b4 a t , but grow at most logarithmically \u03b4 ln a t during radiation domination the Mezsaros e\ufb00ect \u03b4 k,t \u03b4 k,ti ln a t ai radiation dominated a t ai matter dominated 99 17 Now consider the graviational potential perturbation \u03b4\u03a6 x,t , which we can write \u03b4\u03a6 x,t d3k 2\u03c0 3 \u03b4\u03a6 k,t eik x, 100 The perturbed Poisson equation can be written in k space as 2\u03b4\u03a6 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c10\u03b4 k2\u03b4\u03a6 k,t 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c10\u03b4 k,t \u03b4\u03a6 k,t \u03b4 k,t \u03c10 a a2. 101 Accordingly, the sub horizon evolution of the potential perturbation obeys \u03b4\u03a6 k,t \u03b4\u03a6 k,ti a ai 2 radiation dominated constant matter dominated , 102 where we used the scalings in eqn. 99 for \u03b4 k,t and ignored the logarthmic dependence during radiation domination given that is multiplied by a steeper a 2 time evolution. Thus the potential perturbations decay asa 2 during radiation domination because of the Mezsaros e\ufb00ect, but is frozen in at a constant during matter domination. 4.1.3 Super Horizon Growth Rates Crudely speaking, a super horizon perturbation \u03bbprop rph doesn t know it is a perturba tion as it has no causal knowledge of the metric on scales larger than itself. It is essentially an island universe which evolves independently of the regions it is causally disconnected from. In GR perturbation theory, the gravitational potential of these \ufb02uctuations is the perturbation to the metric. The upshot is that these super horizon metric perturbations do not evolve, they are frozen in and thus we have the result that for these modes the potential perturbation is constant in time. Hence for modes with k kH 2\u03c0 dph \u03b4\u03a6 k,t \u03b4\u03a6 k , 103 is constant in time. From Poisson s equation in k space see eqn. 101 k2\u03b4\u03a6 k 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c10 t \u03b4 k,t \u03b4 k,t constant \u03c10a2 . 104 Thus for the growth rate of super horizon density \ufb02uctuations we have that \u03b4 k,t \u03b4 k,ti a ai 2 radiation dominated a ai matter dominated 105 We now begin to better understand why we need to keep track of when modes enter the horizon. As shown in Fig. 1, small scale modes will enter the horizon at early times when the universe is radiation dominated, at which point their density will stop growing actually it 18 Table 1 Growth Rates of Density Perturbations radiation dominated matter dominated \u03b4\u03a6 \u03b4 \u03b4 \u03a6 \u03b4 sub horizon a 2 ln a constant a super horizon constant a2 constant a can grow up to logarithmically depending on initial conditions, but just assume it is constant for now , and its potential will decay as a 2, because of the Mezsaros e\ufb00ect. Larger scale modes which cross the horizon later during matter domination never go through this phase of stunted growth rate or equivalently potential decay. The di\ufb00erent growth rates for sub horizon and super horizon \ufb02uctuations in the potential, \u03b4\u03a6, and density \u03b4, for radiation and matter dominated universes are summarized in Table 1. 4.2 Understanding the Power Spectrum Shape We have now put the pieces together necessary to understand how the linear theory power spectrum gets its shape. There are two important things to highlight before we proceed. Much easier to work with potential \ufb02uctuations \u03a6 In terms of how the perturbations evolve in the di\ufb00erent regimes, i.e. sub horizon vs. super horizon and radiation vs. matter dominated, it is clearly much easier to work with the potential, since Table 1, indicates that the potential \ufb02uctuation basically remains constant in time in all but one case, sub horizon \ufb02uctuations in a radiation dominated universe, where we see that it decays as a 2 due to the Mezsaros e\ufb00ect. Horizon at Matter Radiation Equality It is clear that the comoving particle horizon at matter radiation equality,deq dph aeq , is an important physical scale. Because the particle horizon is a monotically increasing function of a, modes with a comoving size \u03bb d eq larger than the horizon at matter radiation equality entered the horizon when the universe was matter dominated, whereas smaller modes \u03bb deq entered the horizon when the universe was still radiation dominated see Fig. 1 . It is only the latter set of small scale modes which will have their potentials decay due to the Mezsaros e\ufb00ect. The comoving horizon at matter radiation equality is deq dph aeq 2 2 1 cH 1 0 \u2126m 1 zeq 1 2 110 Mpc 106 where we used 1 zeq 3500 \u2126m,0 0.30 h 0.70 , 107 which we previously calculated. Since we are working with the power spectrum, it is more convenient to work with wavenumbers and we introduce keq 2\u03c0 deq 0.06 Mpc 1. 108 19 Now let s consider an initial potential perturbation \u03b4\u03a6 k,ti at some time ti teq, where teq is the time of matter radiation equality, which we would like to evolve forward to some later time after decoupling t tdec, but for which the universe is still matter dominated. For concreteness we will focus on a dark matter perturbation, which dominates the matter, and anyway as we saw in 3.3, the baryons will start tracking the dark matter perturbation shortly after decoupling. Consider modes with k keq \u03bb deq , which will have entered the horizon when the universe was matter dominated. For both the super horizon and sub horizon evolution of these modes the potential perturbation remains constant and thus \u03b4\u03a6 k,t \u03b4\u03a6 k,ti k keq . 109 Now consider smaller scale modes with k keq \u03bb d eq . These modes entered the horizon with potential perturbation at the value \u03b4\u03a6 k,ti which was constant in time, but upon hori zon entry, because the universe is radiation dominated, they su\ufb00er a 2 attenuation because of the Mezsaros e\ufb00ect until the epoch of matter radiation equality \u03b4\u03a6 k,t \u03b4\u03a6 k,ti aenter k aeq 2 k keq ., 110 where aenter k is the scale factor at which the mode k entered the horizon, and the factor aenter aeq 2 re\ufb02ects the attenuation which occurs between the time aenter k and aeq. At later times a aeq the universe is no longer radiation dominated, and so the potential will then remain at a constant value until the time t recall we assumed that at t we are matter dominated . Notice that the time tenter at which the mode k with wavelength \u03bbenters the horizon during radiation domination is \ufb01xed by the evolution of the particle horizon that we computed in eqn. 98 above in 4.1.1 aenter k \u03bb aenter 2\u03c0 k 2ctenter aenterk 1 tenter. 111 But we also have that during radiation domination a t1 2, so combining these two propor tionalities we have aenter k k 1 tenter a2 enter k aenter k 1, 112 which states that high k small scale modes entered the horizon earlier in time, which can be clearly visualized from Fig. 1. This implies we can write the ratio aenter k aeq 2 keq k 2 . 113 20 Thus we obtain \u03b4\u03a6 k,t \u03b4\u03a6 k,ti k keq \u03b4\u03a6 k,ti keq k 2 k keq . 114 Now using \u03b4\u03a6 k,t \u03b4\u03a6 k ,t 2\u03c0 3\u03b4D k k P\u03a6 k,t , 115 we have P\u03a6 k,t P\u03a6 k,ti k keq P\u03a6 k,ti keq k 4 k keq . 116 As we metioned before, in\ufb02ation predicts a scale invariant potential perturbation, which has equal variance on all scales 2 \u03a6 k,ti d\u03c32 \u03a6 dln k k3 2\u03c02 P\u03a6 k,ti constant P\u03a6 k,ti k 3. 117 But the perturbed Poisson s equation eqn. 101 gives k2\u03b4\u03a6 k,t 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c10\u03b4 k,t \u03b4 k,t k2\u03b4\u03a6 k,t , 118 which implies the density and potential power spectra are related via P\u03b4 k4P\u03a6 k P\u03b4 k,ti Ak, 119 where A is a constant. So we \ufb01nally obtain P\u03b4 k,t Ak k k eq Ak keq k 4 k 3 k keq , 120 which explains the shape of the linear theory power spectrum for the overdensity \u03b4, and why the break in the shape occurs around keq 0.06 Mpc 1. In reality the attenuation during radiation domination is more like ln a a2, and furthermore the transition from radiation to matter domination is smooth, which smooths out the peak in the power spectrum. 4.3 Transfer Function What we have gone through in the last section is a simple analytical version of what the so called transfer function is supposed to achieve. Namely, our goal is to write the linear theory power spectrum for overdensity \ufb02uctuations at some time t as P k,t P k,ti T2 k D2 t , 121 where P k,ti is the power spectrum at the time at which the perturbations were created i.e. after in\ufb02ation , D t is the linear growth rate that we de\ufb01ned earlier, and T2 k is the transfer function. The transfer function can be written in terms of a relationship between the mode amplitude 21 Figure 2 The variation of the density contrast in photons red , baryons green and CDM blue with scale factor for k 0.01 Mpc 1 top and k 1.0 Mpc 1 bottom . The density contrasts are plotted in the conformal Newtonian gauge. Note the change in behavior for the small scale modes around aeq 3 10 4, and decoupling at adec 10 3. Figure from Challinor. at a creation scale factor ai time ti , and the mode amplitude at some scale factor am time tm . Typically am is taken to be a time when the universe is still matter dominated, but where am is after recombination. Broadly speaking, the reason for choosing am to be an epoch after recombination is simply that prior to recombination the universe is opaque and 22 structure is not observable. Thus one has T k \u03b4 k,tm \u03b4 k,ti , 122 Note the transfer function is independent of the exact value of scale factor am, provided am is chosen to be when the universe is still matter dominated since at this point there are no other physical e\ufb00ects which could change the power spectrum shape in a k dependent fashion until the universe starts to become \u039b dominated. The transfer function models all the procceses that in\ufb02uence the growth of perturbations from formation until after recombination. We have discussed some but not all of these. The main complication that we have ignored is related to the validity of the \ufb02uid approximation, which we discuss in the next section. There are many publicly avaialble codes to compute T k . The major innovation was CMBFAST by Seljak and Zaldarriaga, as they \ufb01gured out a trick to perform the required Boltzmann equation integrations much faster than was previously possible. There are now other codes that supercede CMBFAST in accuracy and ease of use like CMBEASY, CAMB, CLASS, and PyCosmo. In Fig. 2 we show transfer functions from one of these codes for photons, baryons, and CDM for modes of two di\ufb00erent sizes, one with k keq, whereas the other has k keq. For the small scall modes lower panel , which are Jeans stable k kJ or \u03bb \u03bbJ before recombination, we see acoustic oscillations in the tightly coupled photon baryon \ufb02uid begin after horizon entry a 10 5, and then we observe the baryons catching up to the dark matter after recombination when the Jeans mass plummets. Note that density contrast mode amplitudes appear to not evolve when they are outside the horizon, which appears to run contrary to our discussion in this section, i.e. see Table 1. This results from gauge freedom, i.e. our description of how super horizon modes evolve in 4.1.3 was necessarily gauge dependent. Typically papers on the evolution of T k compare results in di\ufb00erent gauges. See for example Ma Bertschinger 1995 . 5 Hot, Cold, or Warm Dark Matter? 5.1 Free Streaming The \ufb02uid approximation that we have used in these notes is valid only when the mean free path of particles is much smaller than the spatial scale of the perturbation being considered. Otherwise, one has to use the Boltzmann equation to solve for the evolution of distribution functions. Perturbations in a nearly collisionless component e.g. neutrinos, warm or hot dark matter are subject to so called Landau damping, also known as collisionless phase mixing or free streaming . Cold dark matter can be treated as a pressureless \ufb02uid in the limit that the particles are so massive that there is no free streaming due to their random thermal velocities. But for hot or warm dark matter, which could have inherited signi\ufb01cant random thermal motions when the particles decoupled from the thermal bath, free streaming could be signi\ufb01cant. In such cases, one must use the Boltzmann equation to solve for the evolution of perturbations comparable to the free streaming scale. A similar 23 situation arises for photons after decoupling, when they are no longer tightly coupled to the baryons via Thompson scattering. As decoupling is approached, the photon mean free path becomes larger, and photons can di\ufb00use out of overdense regions into underdense regions, thereby damping inhomogeneities in the photon baryon plasma, a phenomenon known as Silk damping. To properly study the evolution of perturbations in the radiation critical e.g. for the CMB and their back reaction on perturbations in matter, one must resort to solving the Boltzmann equation. The transfer function codes that we described in the last section solve the Boltzmann equa tion for various components dark matter, photons, neutrinos for which the \ufb02uid approxi mations are invalid. We won t go into solving the Boltzmann equation for collisionless \ufb02uids, since that is quite complicated. However, su\ufb03ce it to say that something like the \ufb02uid equations comes out, where the pressure is instead contributed by the random motions of the collisionless particles. The same type of linear perturbation theory analysis leads one to conclude that scales larger than a Jeans scale are unstable to gravitational collapse \u03bbJ v \u03c0 G\u03c1 1 2 , 123 where the velocity v replaces the sound speed cs that we had before where v 2 v 2f v d3v f v d3v v 2 , 124 where f v is the collisionless particle i.e. dark matter velocity distribution function. For example for a Maxwellian velocity distribution function v \u03c3. Just like before, small scale modes k kJ give rise to oscillatory solutions, but the crucial di\ufb00erence is that these free streaming motions rapidly dissipate \ufb02uctuations with \u03bb \u03bbFS. Whereas in a \ufb02uid with pressure, you set up oscillations, which could eventually turn into a growing mode for example if the Jeans scale rapidly drops i.e. baryons after recombination , in this collisionless case, the \ufb02uctuations are actually erased because particles in an overdense region can propagate to an underdense region rapidly equalizing any density \ufb02uctuations. Here we will simply estimate what the free streaming length scale is, which you also did on the homework. Once a collisonless species decouples from the thermal bath, which we typically imagine to be an extremely early time tf when the particle froze out, it simply travels along a geodesic in an expanding Universe. We will assume that the particles motion is along a ray with d\u03b8 d\u03c6 0, so that the proper distance that this particle travels in an expanding universe is just a t dx v t dt, where dx is a di\ufb00erential comoving distance. Thus the comoving distance traveled by a free streaming particle from some initial time tf to time t is the integral of these in\ufb01tesimal comoving distance intervals dx, or \u03bbFS t t tf v t a t dt . 125 24 Note the similarity of this expression to the particle horizon dph t t tf c a t dt . 126 Typically the calculation for\u03bbFS t is broken up into several parts, i.e. we assume the particle is relativistic from the time it freezes out tf to some time tNR, when it goes non relativistic, i.e. when mXc2 kBTNR when the the thermal bath had a temperature TNR. For example if we consider massive neutrinos with m\u03bdc2 30 eV, which used to be invoked as a hot dark matter candidate, then they go non relativistic at 1 zNR 60,000, 127 whereas we know that the neutrinos decoupled from the thermal bath approximately 1safter the Big Bang when kBT 1 MeV or at 1 zf 4.3 109. 128 At matter radiation equality zeq 3500 the temperature of the Universe is kBT 1 eV, and the relevant hot or warm dark matter candidates have mass energies larger than this, such that one typically assumes tNR teq. If we break eqn. 126 into contributions from various epochs, we can write \u03bbFS t tNR tf c a t dt teq tNR v t a t dt t teq v t a t dt . 129 The free streaming is dominated by the relativistic part when v t c, because after the particle becomes non relativistic Hubble drag implies v a 1 or v t c aNR a , 130 and the velocity redshifts away quickly. Typcically one evaluates \u03bbFS teq , since structures start growing once the universe is matter dominated. One \ufb01nds \u03bbFS teq 2ctNR aNR 2 ln aeq aNR . 131 Plugging in numbers for neutrinos using the fact that the temperature is slightly di\ufb00erent than the photon temperature T\u03bd 4 11 1 3T\u03b3 this is needed to compute aNR one \ufb01nds \u03bbFS 30 m\u03bd 30 eV 1 Mpc, 132 25 which corresponds to a free streaming mass scale MFS 4\u03c0\u03c1m,0 3 \u03bbFS 2 3 1.3 1015 m\u03bd 30 eV 2 M , 133 where to calculate MFS we used \u2126\u03bdh2 0.32 m\u03bd 30 eV , which results from calculation you did on the neutrino energy density in the homework. The left panel of Fig. 3 compares the linear theory dimensionless power spectrum of hot dark matter to that of cold dark matter illustrating the strong cuto\ufb00 at k 2\u03c0 30 Mpc 1 0.2 Mpc 1. While a host of observations of cosmic structure rules out such a strong cuto\ufb00, the behavior of the power spectrum at much smaller scales is an active \ufb01eld of research. In particular, a so called warm dark matter WDM particle with mWDM 8 keV would have a free streaming scale 100 kpc corresponding to a mass scale of 108M , and is often invoked as a remedy for small scale problems with the cold dark matter model. Observations of dwarf galaxies and the Ly\u03b1forest can be used to constrain or rule out these WDM models. 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 103 k Mpc 1 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 2 k 1018 1016 1014 1012 1010 108 106 104 M M Unknown small scale behavior Baryon Acoustic Oscillations CDM WDM 8keV ADM Cosmic Cluster Galactic linear analytic non linear simulation Figure 3 Left Linear theory power spectrum for hot dark matter compared to cold dark matter. Figure from Martin White. Right Dimensionless power spectrum for cold dark matter compared to an 8 keV warm dark matter model. Figure from Kuhlen, Vogelsberger et al. 2012. 5.2 Hierarchical Structure Formation From the right panel of Fig. 3, we see that in the standard cold dark matter model, the power 2 k k3P k rises rapidly with k for k keq, where the P k k scaling implies 2 k k4, but then subsequently begins to \ufb02atten for k keq 0.06 Mpc 1, re\ufb02ecting the P k ln kk 3 part of the power spectrum where 2 k ln k. This has profound implications for how cosmic structure forms. A good proxy for the progression of structure formation on a given scale is the variance of the excess mass, which we calculated previously to be \u03c32 M R \u03b4M x M 2 R 0 2 k W2 k dln k. 134 26 This integral can be easily evaluated when W k is a Gaussian W x 1 2\u03c0 3 2R3 exp x2 2R2 W k exp k2R2 2 . 135 and P k Akn is a power law, \u03c32 M R A 2 2 k R 1 \u0393 n 3 2 . 136 Since 2 k kn 3 this implies \u03c32 M R R n 3 M n 3 3, 137 where in the last proportionality we used M R3. We know that in the matter dominated phase the amplitude of modes grows as \u03b4k a t t2 3, hence using that \u03c32 \u03b42 k a2 we have that \u03c32 M R,t t4 3R n 3 . 138 We can assume that perturbations at some scale R become nonlinear when \u03c3 R 1. It follows that the time, t R , at which a scale R becomes nonlinear satis\ufb01es the relation tR R3 n 3 4 M n 3 4. 139 For n 3, which is true for the entire power spectrum, we see that tR is an increasing function of R and M. This implies that on average, smaller scales radii and masses be come nonlinear at earlier times than larger scales. This is what is known as hierarchical structure formation. It states that structure formation occurs from the bottom up, with the smallest structures going non linear \ufb01rst, which then merge to form larger non linear structures which collapse later. As each unit goes non linear, it will in general be comprised of a number of smaller condensations which had gone non linear and collapsed earlier. This behavior is a direct result of the shape of the power spectrum of cold dark matter. Hot dark matter models which have a small scale cuto\ufb00 at very large mass scales M 1015M , form structures in a very di\ufb00erent manner. Namely, the \ufb01rst structures to go non linear are large structures, where there is still power present. These large non linear structures then fragment to form smaller non linear structures. Thus for hot dark matter models, structure forms from the top down. A numerical computation of \u03c3 R is shown in Fig. 4 for various cosmogynies. Fig. 5 illustrates the di\ufb00erences in how structure forms for hot, warm, and cold dark matter cosmological models, which all results from the shape of the linear theory power spectrum. 27 Figure 4 The variance of the linear density \ufb01eld, \u03c3 R , as a function of the radius, R, of a top hat window function containing mass M in di\ufb00erent cosmogonic models.

Since most of the observed structures in the universe like galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc. have a density constrast far in excess of unity, their formation can only be understood with a fully nonlinear theory. In the non linear regime the evolution of the density \ufb01eld can no longer be described with a simple growth rate D a . In general no analytic solutions exist. Because non linearity implies mode coupling, we no longer have a Gaussian random \ufb01eld. We previously discussed that this mostly arises due to phase correlations, but the power spectrum will also deviate from linear theory, and furthermore higher order moments besides the two point function are required to describe the evolution. An accurate treatment will of course require solving the equations of structure formation on a computer. But we can consider highly oversimpli\ufb01ed analytical approximations which allow us to build intuition about this non linear evolution which will prove very useful in undertsanding and interpreting these numerical results. 1 Spherical Collapse 1.1 Top Hat Perturbation for an\u2126 1 Universe Figure 1 Illustration of a top hat perturbation for the spherical collapse model. Figure from Vandenbosch. One of the most important nonlinear calculations in cosmology is spherical collapse for which an analytic fully non linear solution exists. We consider a collisionless \ufb02uid i.e dark matter in a \ufb02at matter dominated Einstein De Sitter \u2126 1 .0 universe. Thus we have H 2 3t \u03c1 1 6\u03c0Gt2 D a a t2 3. 1 Imagine that we setup a so called top hat perturbation in an otherwise homogenous universe 1 Figure 2 Left Evolution of a top hat perturbation in an EdS universe. Depending on the E, the \ufb01rst integral of motion, the \ufb02uctuation collapses E 0 , continues to expand E 0 , or asymptotically reaches it maximum radius E 0 . Virialization occurs when the \ufb02uctuation has collapsed to half its turnaround radius. Figure from Norman review. Right Schematic illustration of spherical top hat evolution. The perturbation starts evolving with the Hubble \ufb02ow, follows linear theory at early times, and then detatches from the Hubble \ufb02ow at turnaround tta, and collapses upon itself at tcoll. at some initial time ti, such that \u03b4 r,ti \u03b4i r R 0 r R, 2 where \u03b4i \u03c1i \u03c1i \u03c1i, and \u03c1i is the background density atti. Let ri denote the proper radius of some mass shell inside the top hat at ti. We proceed analogously to our semi classical derivation of the Friedmann equation. Namely we apply Newton s laws to a test particle at radius r, r GM r2 , 3 where M r is the mass interior to r, where we have invoked Birkho\ufb00 s theorem, which states that the gravitational acceleration at any radius in a spherically symmetric system depends only on the mass within that radius. Note that the mass enclosed within the shell can be written M r 4 3\u03c0r3 i \u03c1i 1 \u03b4i 4 3\u03c0r3 t \u03c1 t 1 \u03b4 t , 4 where the second equality is a result of mass conservation, in other words, M r is inde pendent of time. It is important to note that while r is the proper radial coordinate, the quantity r t is also the time dependent variable that we are solving for it is the time evolution of the spherical shell encircling the constant mass M r which was once interior to ri. We can thus imagine that the overdensity consists of in\ufb01nitesimally thin mass shells, where each shell evolves independently because of spherical symmetry. This should hold until shell crossing , which is to say when the shells pass through the origin forming a singularity. 2 Figure 3 Illustration of the evolution of a spherical overdensity embedded in a \ufb02at Einstein de Sitter Universe. The dotted curve shows the linear theory prediction, whereas the dashed curves show the prediction of the nonlinear spherical collapse model. Shell crossing and virialization will prevent the collapse to a singularity radius 0, and resulting in a collapsed structure with a \ufb01nite overdensity and radius, illustrated by the solid lines. Figure from Baumann. In practice, this only happens for the idealized case of perfect spherical symmetry. Integrating the equation of motion eqn. 3 once, exactly as we did when deriving the Friedmann equation, yields 1 2 dr dt 2 GM r E, 5 where the energy E is the speci\ufb01c energy of a given mass shell. The three possibilities for E are illustrated schematically in Fig. 2. Clearly E 0 is going to correspond to a bound system which will eventually collapse, whereas E 0 will not collapse. The case E 0 is worth noting, it yields the solution r t 9GM 2 t2 3 a t . 6 Thus for this special case, the mass shell and hence the entire top hat perturbation grows at the same rate as the universe. Thus the product r3 t \u03c1 t in eqn. 4 is a constant and we have that \u03b4 t \u03b4i, which is to say that the perturbation does not grow. We are most interested in the E 0 case that will collapse. The resulting cycloid solution 3 can be written in parameteric form as r \u03b8 A 1 cos \u03b8 t \u03b8 B \u03b8 sin \u03b8 , 7 where \u03b8 0,2\u03c0 , and A GM 2 E B GM 2 E 3 2 A3 GMB2. 8 This solution is illustrated schematically in Figs. 2 and 3. It implies the following evolution for our mass shell, \u03b8 0 Shell expands from r 0 at time t 0, i.e. this is the Big Bang of the background model. \u03b8 \u03c0 The mass shell reaches its maximum radius rta at t \u03b8 \u03c0 tta \u03c0B. Here the ta subscript stands for turnaround, since the mass shell turns around and begins collapsing. \u03b8 2\u03c0 The mass shell collapses back to r 0 at time t \u03b8 2\u03c0 tcoll 2\u03c0B 2tta. We can gain further insights into the nonlinear evolution of a top hat perturbation by in voking energy conservation. The speci\ufb01c energy of the mass shell we are considering is a constant of the motion, E v2 t 2 GM r v2 i 2 GM ri , 9 where v t dr t dt, and in the last equality we evaluated E at time ti. Consider the behavior of the velocity at early times vi v ti . Imagine de\ufb01ning comoving coordinates for our mass shell which take out the expansion due to the Hubble \ufb02ow r t a t x t , 10 the velocity can be written v dr t dt ax t a x t H t r a x t , 11 at early times when the perturbation is small \u03b4i 1 v ti Hiri, 12 that is, we can negelect the peculiar velocity term a x ti relative to the Hubble \ufb02ow. We can thus write the initial speci\ufb01c energy of the mass shell as Ei Ki Ui 1 2H2 i r2 i GM ri , 13 4 using the Friedmann equation H2 8\u03c0G \u03c1 3 we can write eqn. 4 for M r , M r 4 3\u03c0r3 i \u03c1i 1 \u03b4i H2 i r3 i 2G 1 \u03b4i , 14 which implies Ei Ki\u03b4i H2 i r2 i 2 \u03b4i. 15 Thus collapse requires Ei 0 which implies \u03b4i 0. We can also evaluate the energy at turn around, tta, when r t tta rta and the velocity v t tta 0 must be zero. Since Kta 0, we have Eta Uta GM rta H2 i r3 i 2rta 1 \u03b4i , 16 where in the last equality we used eqn. 14 to express M r in terms of Hi. From energy conservation we must have Eta Ei, allowing us to write rta ri 1 \u03b4i \u03b4i \u03b4 1 i , 17 where we used the fact that the initial perturbation \u03b4i 1. Hence, the turn around radius depends only on the initial overdensity \u03b4i not on the actual mass enclosed by the shell . Note also that smaller perturbations have larger radii at turn around, which implies that they turnaround collapse later. Now let us focus on the evolution of the actual overdensity. The mean density\u03c1 r interior to some radius r within the top hat perturbation is \u03c1 t 3M 4\u03c0r3 3M 4\u03c0A3 1 cos \u03b8 3 , 18 whereas the mean density of the background is \u03c1 t 1 6\u03c0Gt2 1 6\u03c0GB2 \u03b8 sin \u03b8 2 , 19 hence the actual overdensity of our spherical top hat region, according to the fully non linear spherical collapse model, is 1 \u03b4 t \u03c1 \u03c1 9 2 \u03b8 sin \u03b8 2 1 cos \u03b8 3 , 20 where we have used that A3 GMB2. Before we discuss this solution in further detail, we will \ufb01rst compare it to linear theory. 1.2 Comparison to Linear Theory One of the main uses of the spherical collapse model is that it allows us to obtain a mapping between the extrapolated linear theory evolution of perturbations and their fully non linear 5 evolution. This then provides a simple tool for determining when perturbations in the initial linear \ufb02uctuations go non linear and when they collapse. We will use this mapping when we discuss the Press Schecter model for the abundance of dark matter halos, which allows one to compute halo abundances analytically using only the linear theory power spectrum. According to linear perturbation theory, in an Einstein De Sitter universe perturbations grow according to \u03b4lin D a a t2 3 \u03b4lin \u03b4i t ti 2 3 . 21 In order to compare our linear theory to the fully non linear spherical collapse solution, we need to determine how to normalize the linear theory solution, which amounts to matching the initial conditions of our spherical collapse calculation. To do this, we Taylor expand the non linear solution for the overdensity in eqn. 20 . Using sin \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b83 3! \u03b85 5! ... 22 cos \u03b8 1 \u03b82 2! \u03b84 4! ..., 23 where we can ignore higher order terms, since the validity of linear theory requires \u03b4 1, which implies t tta \u03c0B and hence \u03b8 1. Thus \u03b8 sin \u03b8 2 \u03b83 6 \u03b85 120 2 \u03b86 36 1 \u03b82 10 24 1 cos \u03b8 3 \u03b82 2 \u03b84 24 3 \u03b86 8 1 \u03b82 4 . 25 Combining we \ufb01nd that in the \u03b8 1 limit 1 \u03b4 9\u03b86 36 1 \u03b82 10 2\u03b86 8 1 \u03b82 4 1 \u03b82 10 1 \u03b82 4 1 3\u03b82 20 , 26 from which we conclude that \u03b4 3\u03b82 20 . 27 If we now use that t B \u03b8 sin \u03b8 B\u03b83 6 , 28 we see that in the \u03b8 1 limit \u03b8 6t B 1 3 . 29 Substituting the above expression for \u03b8 into eqn. 27 for \u03b4 we \ufb01nally obtain that that for 6 t tta \u03c0B, which implies \u03b8 1 and \u03b4 1, \u03b4 t 3 20 6t B 2 3 \u03b4 1 . 30 Thus as expected, we see that in the small \u03b4 regime, the spherical collapse solution recovers the \u03b4 t2 3 a behavior of linear theory. Noting that the linear theory solution follows \u03b4lin \u03b4i t ti 2 3 , 31 to match the small t small \u03b8 and \u03b4 behavior of the linear and nonlinear solution, we can evaluate both at t ti, which implies B 3ti 4 5\u03b4i 3 3 2 , 32 combining with A3 GMB2 and the expression for M in eqn. 14 , we deduce that A 3ri 10\u03b4i . 33 Hence the non linear solution is completely speci\ufb01ed in terms of quantities at ti. Note that since B only depends on ti and \u03b4i, the time for turn around tta \u03c0B and for collapse tcoll 2\u03c0B, occur simultaneously for all mass shells. Formally, at tcoll all the mass collapses to a singularity, but we will return to what actually happens at collapse for a more realistic not perfectly spherically symmetric situation shortly. Next we want to study the linear evolution on the same clock as the non linear evolution. The equations above apply to \u03b8 1, but we need to use t \u03b8 in eqn. 7 for larger \u03b8. Thus we combine the two equations \u03b4lin \u03b4i t ti 2 3 t B \u03b8 sin \u03b8 34 to obtain \u03b4lin 3 5 3 4 2 3 \u03b8 sin \u03b8 2 3 . 35 We have now expressed the linear theory solution in terms of the parameters of our fully non linear solution, allowing us to compare their predictions at di\ufb00erent times. This mapping between linear and non linear evolution is very powerful. Given the linear theory evolution of a density \ufb02uctuation, we can then make statements about what the fully nonlinear density constrast should be assuming spherical collapse. Some relevant times are calculated in Table 1. When a region is at turnaround with \u03b8 \u03c0 and t tta and is detatching from the Hubble \ufb02ow, \u03b4 \u03b8 \u03c0 4 .6, so the characteristic overdensity of regions turning around is \u03b4ta 4.6! Furthermore, at this time, the linear theory contrast is 7 \u03b4lin,ta \u03b8 \u03c0 1.06. Consider a region that had a linear \ufb02uctuation of \u03b4lin 0.1 at z 20. 36 Our calculation thus implies it was at turnaround roughly at a tta a z 20 \u03b4lin \u03b4lin,ta 1 zta 1 20 \u03b4lin \u03b4lin,ta 1 zta 2.0. 37 Furthermore, according to Table 1, we learn that att 2\u03c0when the spherical collapse model implies collapse to a singularity, the linear theory density contrast is \u03b4lin 1.69. Thus if we extrapolate linear theory to have an overdensity \u03b4lin 1.69, this corresponds to a region which has t t coll in the spherical collapse model. For this reason we de\ufb01ne the threshold \u03b4c 1.69 38 as the critical overdensity for collapse. We will see that \u03b4c plays a very important role in Press Schecther theory. Although our derivation focused on a top hat perturbation with value \u03b4i it can be shown that our treatment is also valid for any monotonically decreasing with r perturbation, with the understanding that we then replace \u03b4 with \u03b4. As for the cosmological model, our results were computed for an Einstein De Sitter universe, but it turns out the critical density for collapse \u03b4c is also remarkably insensitive to cosmology. What are the turnaround and collapse redshifts of a perurbation at z 100 which has \u03b4i 0.1?

In the idealized spherically symmetric calculation we performed, this shell crossing \ufb01nally happens at\u03b8 2\u03c0, which is the instant when all the mass collapses to a point. However, long before this happens the approximation that the matter is distributed in perfectly spherically symmetric shells, and that the random i.e. non radial velocities of the particles are small, will break down. The collisionless matter we are considering will reach what is known as virial equilibrium by a process known as violent relaxation. Violent relaxation occurs as follows. During the collapse there will be large \ufb02uctuations in the gravitational potential, on a time scale or order of the free fall collapse time tdyn G\u03c1 1 2. Since the potential is changing with time, individual particles do not follow energy conserving orbits. The change in energy of a particle over this collapse timescale will depend in a complex way on its initial position and velocity, but the net e\ufb00ect will be to redistribute energy among the particles and widen the range of energies available to the particles. Thus a rapidly time variable potential provides a mechanism for particles to exchange energy and relax to an equilibrium distribution on a timescale tdyn which is much shorter than the 2 body relaxation timescale trelax Ntdyn 10 lnN , which is normally the timescale which governs the evolution of a self gravitating distribution of N particles. Since the dark matter particle mass is likely extremely small, the 2 body relaxation time would be many orders of magnitude larger than the Hubble time trelax tH. Violent relaxation operates much faster, and allows energy exchange on tdyn because of the rapidly varying gravitational potential. The end result of violent relaxation will be that the system arives in a quasi static equilibrium state1 in which its random motions provide the equivalent of pressure support against gravity. This equilibrium is known as virial equilibrium. The virial theorem states that any bound system of particles interacating via forces will obey I 2U 4K, 39 where I is the moment of inertia of the system and U and K are the potential and kinetic energy, respectively. If violent relaxation drives our collapsing perturbation toward virial equilibrium, i.e. steady state, then I 0, and we have 2K U 0 E K U K U 2. 40 We can now work out the \ufb01nal size of the collapsed and viralized dark matter halo by the following argument. Recall that at t tta all the energy was gravitational potential energy because the kinetic energy of all mass shells is zero. For a spherically symmetric distribution 1No self gravitating system is truly in equilibrium, but since trelax tH we can think of it as e\ufb00ectively being in equilibrium since the timescale on which it evolves is so long. 9 Figure 4 Evolution of an over dense region in spherical top hat approximation. Figure from Padmanabhan. of matter with constant density and size rta, the potential energy is Uta 3GM2 5rta Eta Uta Kta Uta 3GM2 5rta . 41 The system will collapse and virialize at tcoll tvir 2tta, at which point it will have a size rvir. If the distribution of mass were uniform at this point, its potential energy would be likewise Uvir 3GM2 5rvir , 42 where rvir is the virial radiusof the collapsed object. The virial theorem then implies Evir Uvir 2 3GM2 5 2rvir 43 10 and since energy has to be conserved Evir Eta rvir rta 2 . 44 The mean overdensity within rvir at tvir tcoll is then 1 vir \u03c1 tvir \u03c1 tvir \u03c1 tta rta rvir 3 \u03c1 tvir \u03c1 tta \u03c1 2tta rta rvir 3 \u03c1 tta \u03c1 tta \u03c1 tta \u03c1 2tta rta rvir 3 . 45 But from the sperhical collapse model we know that at tta \u03b8 \u03c0 \u03c1 tta \u03c1 tta 1 \u03b4 tta 9\u03c02 16 5.55, 46 see e.g. Table 1 , whereas \u03c1 tta \u03c1 2tta a 2tta a tta 3 2tta tta 2 3 3 4, 47 and rvir rta 2 rta rvir 3 8, 48 so we \ufb01nally have 1 vir 9\u03c02 16 \u03c1 tta \u03c1 tta 4 \u03c1 tta \u03c1 2tta 8 rta rvir 3 18\u03c02 178. 49 Thus we have derived the charachteristic or virial overdensityof a collapsed object vir 178 in addition to the characteristic size rvir rta 2. If \u2126 m 1, the situation is slightly more complicated, because then vir depends on the \u2126 m tvir and \u2126 m tvir 2 . A useful approximation is given by vir 18\u03c02 82x 39x2 1 x , 50 where x \u2126m tvir 1 from Bryan and Norman, 1998 . Figure 4 illustrates the density pro\ufb01le evolution in the non linear and linear regime, as well as the charachteristic scale factors and densities in the spherical collapse model. 1.4 Dark Matter Halos In the previous section we were able to determine that a collapsed region of sizervir containing a mass M has average density which is 18\u03c02 larger than the cosmic mean density, that is Mvir \u03c1virV 18\u03c02 \u03c1 t 4\u03c0 3 r3 vir vir \u03c1 t 4\u03c0 3 r3 vir. 51 11 This result allows us to determine the characteristic size, density, velocity, and temperature of the baryonic component for a collapsed object of a given mass. These collapsed objects are known as dark matter halos. Although spherical collapse captures some of the physics governing the formation of halos, structure formation in a cold dark matter universe proceeds hierarchically. At early times, most of the dark matter was in low mass halos, and these halos then continously accreted and merged to form high mass halos. Using high resolution N body simulations to model gravitational instability of collisionless cold dark matter CDM particles with initial condi tions drawn from the linear theory power spectrum P k , Navarro et al. 1996 showed that the spherically averaged density pro\ufb01les of the resulting halos are described by a roughly uni versal function although there is considerable scatter among di\ufb00erent halos. This so called NFW short for Navarro Frenk White pro\ufb01le has the form \u03c1 r \u03c1s r rs 1 r rs 2 , 52 which is completely characterized by two parameters, mass Mvir and the concentration pa rameter c rvir rs. Here rvir is related to Mvir via eqn. 51 and the spherical collapse overdensity vir. The quantity \u03c1s is given by \u03c1s \u03c1m z vir c3 3f c , 53 where \u03c1m z \u03c1crit z \u2126m z 1 z 3\u2126m0 3H2 0 8\u03c0G, 54 and f x ln 1 x x 1 x. 55 The corresonding mass pro\ufb01le is M r Mvir f cx f c x r rvir . 56 The concentration parameter c c M,z is a function of the halo mass and time. Actually it is more appropriate to think of the concenration as a function of halo mass and formation redshift, since halos which collapse earlier are more dense. Various \ufb01tting formulae for c M,z can be found in the literature. 2 Press Schecter Formalism According to linear theory, the density \ufb01eld evolves as \u03b4 x,t D t \u03b40 x , 57 12 where \u03b40 x is the density \ufb01eld linearly extrapolated to t t0, and D t is the linear growth rate normalized to unity at t t0. For an Einstein de Sitter Universe D a a since a t0 1. The spherical collapse model taught us that if we linearly extrapolate the growth of perturbations forward in time regions with \u03b4 x,t \u03b4c 1.686, 58 will have collapsed to produce dark matter haloes by time t. In this section, we examine how we can assign a dark halo mass to some location in the linear density \ufb01eld which has \u03b4 x,t \u03b4c, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Schematic illustration of the linear theory density \ufb01eld along a slice in position. Regions that are above the linear theory collapse threshold \u03b4c 1.686 should have collapsed to form dark matter halos. According to the spherical collapse model, regions with \u03b4 x,t \u03b4c will have collapsed to produce dark matter halos by time t. We can also view this situation di\ufb00erently, exploiting that \u03b4 x,t D t \u03b40 x , we can instead imagine that regions with \u03b40 x \u03b4c D t , 59 will have collapsed to produce dark matter halos by time t. In this latter case, we consider the linear density \ufb01eld to be static at the value extrapolated to our reference time t0, while the collapse barrier evolves with time, getting progressively lower as the growth factor D t increases with time toward unity. In the Press Schechter formalism, this latter way of viewing the barrier as decreasing with time will be the preferred approach. Previously, when discussing statistical measures of the density \ufb01eld, we de\ufb01ned the relative 13 mass excess \u03b4M x \u03b4MR MR d3k 2\u03c0 3 \u03b4 k W k eik x, 60 which is just a smoothed version of the density \ufb01eld. We argued that the variance of this random \ufb01eld two point correlation at zero lag can be written \u03c32 R \u03b42 M x 0 2 k W2 k dln k, 61 from the convolution theorem and the de\ufb01nition of the power spectrum. Two common choices for \ufb01lter functions are the top hat and the Gaussian top hat W x 3 4\u03c0R3 x R 0 otherwise W k 3 kR 3 sin kr kRcos kR Gaussian W x 1 2\u03c0 3 2R3 exp x2 2R2 W k exp k2R2 2 . 62 The mass associated with a the \ufb01lter of size R is top hat M 4\u03c0R3 3 \u03c1 Gaussian M 2\u03c0 3 2R3 \u03c1, 63 which means that we can either label a \ufb01lter by its size R or its mass M. Previously we argued that the mass variance is a good proxy for the progression of structure formation on a given scale, and noted that for a power law power spectrum P k Akn the resulting scaling \u03c32 M R R n 3 M n 3 3, 64 implies that small scale structures go non linear at earlier times, giving rise to hiearchical structure formation. The mass variance as a function of scale R is shown in Fig. 6. Because convolution is a linear operation, if \u03b4 x is a Gaussian random \ufb01eld, then the same holds for the \ufb01ltered \ufb01eld \u03b4M x . Thus we can write that the probability distribution of \u03b4M x P \u03b4M d\u03b4M 1 2\u03c0\u03c3M exp \u03b42 M 2\u03c32 M d\u03b4M, 65 where we use the shorthand notation \u03b4M x \u03b4M and \u03c3M \u03c3 M . The idea behind the Press Schechter model for the abundance of dark matter halos is ex ceedingly simple. Press Schechter 1974 postulated that the probability that \u03b4M \u03b4c t is the same as the mass fraction that at time t is contained in halos with mass greater than M. The probability that \u03b4M \u03b4c t can be easily calculated. For a Gaussian random \ufb01eld, 14 Figure 6 Mass \ufb02uctuations and collapse thresholds in cold dark matter models. The horizontal dotted lines show the value of the extrapolated collapse overdensity \u03b4c t at the indicated redshifts. Also shown is the value of \u03c3 M for a CDM model with the benchmark model cosmological parameters, as well as \u03c3 M for a power spectrum with a cuto\ufb00 below a mass M 1.7 108 M short dashed curve , or M 1.7 1011 M long dashed curve . The intersection of the horizontal lines with the \u03c3 M curves indicate, at each redshift z, the mass scale for each model at which a \ufb02uctuation is just collapsing at z, which is to say that it indicates the value of the quantity M t de\ufb01ned in eqn. 77 . Figure from Barkana and Loeb. one has that P \u03b4M \u03b4c t 1 2\u03c0\u03c3M \u03b4c t exp \u03b42 M 2\u03c32 M d\u03b4M 1 2 erfc \u03b4c t 2\u03c3M , 66 15 where erfc x 1 erf x is the complimentary error function, and where again \u03b4c t \u03b4c D t , such that the collapse barrier evolves downard with time. According to the Press Schecter postulate above, we thus have F M,t 1 2 erfc \u03b4c t 2\u03c3M . 67 There is however a serious problem with the Press Schecter postulate. As M 0, then \u03c3 M , as can be seen from the scaling relations in eqn. 64 this assumes that n 3, which is the case for CDM power spectra, hence \u03c3 M will always be a decreasing function of M . As we discussed before, this scaling is what drives hierarchical structure formation, or the fact that in CDM collapse occurs from the bottom up. But as M 0, F M,t 1 2, which suggests that only half of the mass in the universe is part of collapsed objects of any mass. This necessarily results from the Press Schecter postulate of associating positive linear theory density \ufb02uctucations with collapsed structures, and the fact that we are dealing with a Gaussian random \ufb01eld which is symmetric about zero, implying that the cumulative probability for a positive density \ufb02uctuation is P \u03b4 0 1 2. 68 In linear theory, where \ufb02uctuations grow proportional to the linear growth rate \u03b4 x,t D a , the positive \ufb02uctuations become more positive, and the negative \ufb02uctuations become more negative, and so there is no way for the half of the volume of the universe corresponding to negative \ufb02uctuations to contain collapsed objects. However, underdense regions can be enclosed within larger overdense regions, giving them a \ufb01nite probability of being included in a larger collapsed object, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Press Schechter argued, without a proper demonstration, that the material in initially underdense regions will eventually be accreted by the collapsed objects, doubling their masses without changing the shape of the mass function. They thus solved this problem by simply introducing a fudge factor of a factor of 2, and instead adopted F M,t 2P \u03b4M \u03b4c t erfc \u03b4c t 2\u03c3M . 69 The quantity F M,t gives the cumulative distribution of the masses at any time t. A more useful quantity is the so called mass function, which is the number density of dark matter halos in the mass range M M dM, n M,t dM. 70 Accordingly, if we assume, following the PS postulate, that the entire mass density of the universe is comprised of collapsed dark matter halos distributed across mass according to 16 Figure 7 Schematic illustration of the linear theory density \ufb01eld along a slice in position. Underdense regions that reside within larger overdense regions should have a \ufb01nite proba bility of being included in some larger collapsed object, but this is not the case in the PS model where only \u03b4M 0 \ufb02uctuations every get incorporated into collapsed halos. eqn. 69 , then we have M 0 n M ,t M dM \u03c1 M 0 F M,t M dM , 71 or di\ufb00erentiating both sides we \ufb01nally obtain n M,t \u03c1 M F M,t M 2 \u03c1 M P \u03b4c t \u03c3 d\u03c3 dM 2 \u03c0 \u03c1 M2 \u03b4c t \u03c3 M exp \u03b42 c t 2\u03c32 M dln \u03c3 M dln M . 72 This is known as the Press Schechter PS mass function. Note that time enters eqn. 72 only through \u03b4c t \u03b4c D t , and that mass enters through \u03c3 M and its derivative. If we de\ufb01ne the variable \u03bd \u03b4c t \u03c3 M , 73 the PS mass function can be written in a more compact form n M,t \u03c1 M2 fPS \u03bd dln \u03bd dln M , 74 where fPS \u03bd 2 \u03c0\u03bdexp \u03bd2 2 , 75 17 is the multiplicity function which gives the fraction of the mass associated with halos in a unit range of ln \u03bd. Figure 8 PS dark matter mass function at several redshifts z 0 solid curve , z 5 dotted curve , z 10 short dashed curve , z 20 long dashed curve , and z 30 dot dashed curve . Figure from Barkana and Loeb. The PS formalism provides an extremely useful way to understand how nonlinear structure forms in a hierarchical model. As can be seen from eqn. 72 , halos with mass M can only form in a signi\ufb01cant number when \u03c3 M \u03b4c t . 76 18 We can de\ufb01ne a characterstic mass M t by the condition that \u03c3 M t \u03b4c t \u03b4c D t , 77 where \u03b4c 1.686 is the linear collapse threshold from the spherical collapse model and D t is the linear growth factor. This can be visualized in Figure 6 where one sees that M t is the value of M at which the horizontal dotted lines indicating \u03b4c t at any t, intersects \u03c3 M . From the equations above and the PS mass function, we see that only halos with M M can have formed in sign\ufb01cant number at a time t. Since D t increases with t, and in hierarchical CDM models, \u03c3 M M n 3 6, is a decreasing function of M see eqn. 64 we get M t D6 n 3 t D\u03b1 t , 78 for a power law power spectrum P k kn. On mass scales between M 1012 14 h 1M , the spectral index varies from about n 2 at the low mass end to n 1.5. Thus the exponent above varies from \u03b1 6 to \u03b1 4, and is thus a strongly increasing function of time. Thus, as time passes, more and more massive halos will start to go nonlinear and form. The PS mass function is plotted in Fig. 8 for several di\ufb00erent redshifts. We see that the mass function has a power law form which is attenuated by an exponential at the higest masses. The transition from power law to expontential occurs around the characteristic mass scale M . Intuitively this exponential suppression for M M makes sense. Since at a time tan M halo corresponds to a \u03b4M 1.686 D t level positive \ufb02uctuation in the gaussian linear density \ufb01eld which has standard deviation \u03c3 M . A much larger mass would correspond to a much rarer event in the initial conditions, which are are exponentially unlikely given the Gaussian initial conditions. 19",

Density \ufb02uctuations present at the time of decoupling source \ufb02uctuations in the CMB temperature both through their coupling to the radiation \ufb01eld and through their perturbation of the space time metric. This information is encoded in the power spectrum of temperature anisotropies which have been recently measured to unprecedented precision by the Planck satellite. The Planck all sky CMB map is shown in Fig. 1, and the temperature power spectrum is shown in Fig. 2. Our goal in this lecture is to relate the features in this power spectrum to what we have learned so far about structure formation. Figure 1 The anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background CMB as observed by Planck. 1 Spherical Harmonics Observations of the CMB provide us with microwave temperature maps of the entire sky. We need to be able to deal with a continuous spectrum of temperature \ufb02uctuations, and the natural way of doing this is to take the Fourier transform of the intensity distribution. The temperature \ufb02uctuations are distributed over the surface of a sphere, and so we need the two dimensional spherical polar equivalent of the relation between the density distribution and its power spectrum, which we derived previously when we related the amplitude of Fourier modes to the power spectrum in three Cartesian dimensions. For the surface of a sphere, the appropriate complete sets of orthonormal functions are the spherical harmonic functions. The \ufb01rst step is to make a spherical harmonic expansion of the temperature \ufb02uctuation over 1 Figure 2 Left The power spectrum of CMB temperature anisotropies as measured by Planck shown with power on a linear scale.

From the orthogonality condition above, the values of the a\u2113m are found by multiplying the temperature distribution by Y \u2113m and integrating over the sphere a\u2113m 4\u03c0 T T \u02c6n Y \u2113md\u2126. 3 Similar to the cosmological density perturbation \u03b4 x , the observed CMB sky should be considered as one realization of a cosmological random \ufb01eld. For the density perturbation we de\ufb01ned the power spectrum via the two point correlation of the Fourier amplitudes, and used statistical isotropy and homogeneity to show that \u03b4 k \u03b4 k 2\u03c0 3\u03b4D k k P k . 4 What is the implication of statistical isotropy and homogeneity for the two point correlation 2 of the a\u2113m? It turns out we must have a\u2113ma \u2113 m C\u2113\u03b4\u2113\u2113 \u03b4mm , 5 where C\u2113 is the angular power spectrum . By statistical isotropy there should be no preferred directions on the sky such that each of the 2 \u2113 1 coe\ufb03cients a\u2113m provides an independent estimate of the amplitude of the temperature \ufb02uctuations associated with the multipole \u2113. The power spectrum C\u2113 can thus be written C\u2113 1 2\u2113 1 m a\u2113ma \u2113m a\u2113m 2 . 6 Equivalent to the power spectrum description, we can de\ufb01ne an auto correlation function of the temperature \ufb02uctuations as C \u03b8 T T \u02c6n T T \u02c6n , 7 where cos \u03b8 \u02c6n \u02c6n is the angle between the two directions on the sky. The correlation function is related to the power spectrum C\u2113 by C \u03b8 1 4\u03c0 \u2113 2\u2113 1 C\u2113P\u2113 cos \u03b8 , 8 where P\u2113 is the Legendre polynomial of degree \u2113, and we have used eqn. 6 and properties of the spherical harmonics to derive this expression. It follows that the two point correlation depends only on the angle between the two directions on the sky \u03b8, as required by statistical isotropy. Note that the variance of the temperature \ufb01eld is just the two point correlation at zero lag, i.e. C 0 , which from above C 0 T T \u02c6n 2 \u03c32 \u2113 2\u2113 1 4\u03c0 C\u2113 dln \u2113\u2113 \u2113 1 C\u2113 2\u03c0 . 9 We thus have an expression analogus to what we obtained in 3 d 2 k k3 2\u03c02 P k d\u03c32 dln k, 10 where here we identify the quantity \u2113 \u2113 1 C\u2113 2\u03c0 d\u03c32 dln \u2113, 11 as the dimensionless power spectrum, which is the amount of variance per logarithmic mul 3 tipole interval dln \u2113. It is customary to plot the quantity 2 T \u2113 \u2113 1 2\u03c0 C\u2113 T2, 12 which is actually the power spectrum of T, since T2 has been multiplied in, and thus has units of temperature squared, which is why the units of the power spectra in Figure 2 have units of \u00b5K2. Finally, we will often need to know the relationship between multipole \u2113 and angular scale \u03b8. For small sections of the sky where its curvature can be neglected, the spherical harmonic analysis becomes ordinary Fourier analysis on a \ufb02at two dimensional surface T T n a\u2113mY\u2113m d2\u2113 T T \u2113 ei\u2113 \u03b8, 13 where this \ufb02at sky approximation is valid for \u2113 100. For these high multipoles which are well described by standard Fourier analysis, the angular scale corresponding to a given harmonic is obviously given by \u03b8 2\u03c0 \u2113. For larger angular scales and lower multipoles, where the spherical harmonics di\ufb00er from Fourier modes, the angular scale corresponding to harmonic \u2113 is roughly given by \u03b8\u2113 \u03c0 \u2113. 14 Note that the density \ufb02uctuations at decoupling are so small that they are de\ufb01nitely in the linear regime. Since we believe that in\ufb02ation gave rise to Gaussian initial conditions, and since we will see that the CMB temperature \ufb02uctuations are proportional to the density pe rurbations, the CMB temperature \ufb02uctuation is a Gaussian random \ufb01eld, which implies that the power spectrum C\u2113 or equivalently the correlation function C \u03b8 provides a complete statistical description of the \ufb02uctuation distribution. This assumption of the Gaussianity of the CMB has been tested to high precision. 2 Physical Origin of Anisotropies 2.1 Overview We will now proceed to consider the physical origin of CMB anisotropies. First, one must distinguish between primary anisotropies which are generated at the last scattering sur face, and secondary anisotropies, which are generated by processes like electron scattering or gravitational redshifts that occur along the line of sight as the CMB photons propagate towards earth. Primary Anisotropies There are three basic primary e\ufb00ects which are important on large, intermediate, and small angular scales, respectively. They are Superhorizon Fuctuations The Sachs Wolfe e\ufb00ect is a source of temperature anisotropy due to gravitational parturbations at the last scattering surface. It generates 4 Figure 3 Illustration of the physical mechanisms that cause CMB anisotropies. The shaded arc on the right represents the last scattering shell. Inhomogeneities on this shell a\ufb00ects the CMB through its potential density \ufb02uctuations on both super and sub horizon scales. Non zero velocities at last scattering give rise to Doppler perturbations. Further perturbations are added along the line of sight by time varying potentials ISW Rees Sciama e\ufb00ect and by electron scattering from hot gas Sunyaev Zeldovich e\ufb00ect . The density \ufb01eld at last scattering can be Fourier analyzed into modes of wavevector k. These spatial perturbation modes have a contribution that is in general damped by averaging over the shell of last scattering. Short wavelength modes are more heavily a\ufb00ected i because more of them \ufb01t inside the scattering shell, and ii because their wavevectors point more nearly radially for a given projected wavelength. temperature anisotropies on a scale larger than the particle horizon at the last scat tering surface. Since causal processes cannot in\ufb02uence perturbation evolution on these scales, the temperature anisotropy results from the impact of the density potential \ufb02uctuations on the metric itself, making this a purely gravitational e\ufb00ect. Subhorizon Fluctuations Below the horizon scale at the last scattering surface, causal processes like pressure forces and the propagation of sound waves can operate. The tightly coupled baryon photon \ufb02uid results in acoustic oscillations driven by the dark matter density potential \ufb02uctuations. Since the photons are tightly coupled to the baryons, the densities of the two \ufb02uids scale proportionately nb n\u03b3 n\u03b3 T3 \u03c1b nbmb T3, 15 5 where the n\u03b3 T3 results from the fact that the photons are a black body radiation \ufb01eld. Di\ufb00erentiating \u03c1b T3, we \ufb01nd T T 1 3 \u03b4\u03c1b \u03c1b \u03b4b 3 . 16 Thus we see that \ufb02uctuations in the baryon density source CMB temperature anisotropies. These are often referred to as isentropic or adiabatic perturbations, which is actually a statement about the nature of the initial conditions on the modes before they entered the horizon. These initial conditions are set by the physics of in\ufb02ation, and isen tropic adiabatic initial conditions mean that the ratio of matter to radiation, which is equivalent to the entropy per baryon, is conserved. Doppler Flucutations The photon baryon \ufb02uid has a non zero velocity at last scattering. Scattering of CMB photons o\ufb00 of electrons with non zero velocities leads to Doppler shifts in photon frequency and hence in the temperature of the CMB. Secondary Anisotropies There are three primary sources of secondary anisotropies. We will not have time to discuss these and only mention them very brie\ufb02y Integrated Sachs Wolfe Rees Sciama E\ufb00ectsresult from CMB photons travers ing time varying potentials along the line of sight. This sources additional temperature anisotropy. Sunyaev Zeldovich E\ufb00ect When CMB photons encounter hot plasma along the line of sight they will be Compton up scattered to higher frequencies. The largest SZ signals are associated with foreground clusters of galaxies, which are large collapsed non linear structures at low redshift which have plasma temperatures of T 107 K. Thomson Scattering from ReionizationWhen the universe is reionized atz 7 8 the free electrons can Thompson scatter CMB photons. This has as a small e\ufb00ect on the temperature anisotropy pattern, but results in a large e\ufb00ect on the polarization of the CMB, since Thompson scattering of a quadropole anisotropy produces linear polarization. Our strategy for understanding CMB anisotropies will be to start with the largest angular scales and progress to smaller scales. We will \ufb01rst learn about the Sachs Wolfe e\ufb00ect, which is the dominant source of large angular scale anisotropy. Moving to smaller sub horizon angular scales brings in causal processes which complicates analysis. We will attempt to understand some of the characteristic behavior like the origin of the acoustic peaks at intermediate angular scales and the damping of \ufb02uctuations on small angular scales. Finally, we will conclude by describing how a full numerical calculation of the CMB power spectrum is performed by solving the Boltzmann equation, which will help us better understand the complexity of the physics. 6 2.2 Large Angular Scales 2.2.1 The Particle Horizon On the homework you computed the particle horizon at decoupling, and we similarly calcu lated this quantity when discussing in\ufb02ation rph tdec tdec 0 cdt a t 274 cMpc. 17 This comoving distance corresponds to a proper distance ofdph adecdph tdec 0.251 Mpc ctdec at tdec. We previously found that dA tdec 12 .8 Mpc, and hence a patch of the last scattering surface with size equal to the particle horizon will subtend an angle \u03b8ph rph tdec dA tdec 1 zdec 1.1 \u2113ph \u03c0 \u03b8ph 163. 18 Thus any \ufb02uctuation with multipole \u2113 160 represents a super horizon temperature \ufb02uctu ation. When we discussed structure formation, we argued that evolution of super horizon modes di\ufb00ers signi\ufb01cantly from sub horizon modes. Whereas we could analyze the behavior of sub horizon \ufb02uctuations using Newtonian mechanics, as expressed by the Euler and continuity equations, we argued that super horizon \ufb02uctuations evolve di\ufb00erently. A super horizon mode is not in causal contact with itself, and so things like sound waves cannot propagate across it. In GR perturbation theory, the gravitational potential of these \ufb02uctuations is the perturbation to the metric, and thus we have the result that for these modes the potential perturbation is constant in time. When we discussed the shape of the matter power spectrum P k , we argued that what were super horizon modes are constantly entering the horizon as the Universe expands be cause the horizon grows with time faster than the proper length scale or equivalently, a comoving length scale stays \ufb01xed with time but the comoving particle horizon grows with the expansion . Analogously, because the universe expanded by a factor of 1000 since tdec, we are now able to see many horizon size 1 patches of the CMB that were not in causal contact with each other. The \ufb02uctuations on these scales retain their primordial character since they will not have been modi\ufb01ed by any causal processes inside the horizon before tdec. These frozen in potential \ufb02uctuations thus contain unique information about the form of the unprocessed initial power spectrum of \ufb02uctuations put in place by in\ufb02ation. These can be directly measured via the Sachs Wolfe e\ufb00ect, as we discuss next. 2.2.2 The Sachs Wolfe E\ufb00ect On large scales the dominant contribution to T T is the Sachs Wolfe e\ufb00ect. This is a relativistic e\ufb00ect due to the fact that photons travelling to an observer from the last scattering surface encounter metric perturbations which cause them to change frequency. The Sachs Wolfe e\ufb00ect is actually a manifestation of two releativistic e\ufb00ects. 7 Gravitational Redshift Imagine an overdensity at recombination which gives rise to a gravitational potential \ufb02ucutation \u03b4\u03a6. First there will be a gravitational redshift resulting from the density \ufb02uctuations, and at decoupling the temperature re\ufb02ects a snapshot of the potential well the photons were in at the time of last scattering Einit \u03b4\u03a6 Einit c2 photon mass E\ufb01nal \u03b4E E \u03b4\u03a6 c2 . 19 But the photons obey the Bose Einstein distribution function fBE 1 eE kBT 1, 20 which is a conserved quantity. So this implies \u03b4T T \u03b4\u03a6 c2 . 21 Thus in an overdense region \u03b4\u03a6 0 there will be a net decrease of temperature \u03b4T 0 due to the gravitational redshift of the photons. Time Dilation In the limit of weak \ufb01elds, one can write the perturbed FRW metric as ds2 1 2\u03a6 c2 dt2 a t 1 2\u03a6 c2 dx2 dy2 dz2 , 22 where the coordinate time tis the cosmic time of the background unperturbed model. Com pare a clock in the region with a potential perturbation \u03b4\u03a6 to one in the background unper turbed \u03b4\u03a6 0 universe. To calculate the proper time interval d\u03c4 in this perturbed universe, we want to evaluate the metric at \ufb01xed spatial coordinates dx dy dz 0, which implies d\u03c42 ds2 1 2\u03a6 c2 dt2 d\u03c4 1 2\u03a6 c2 dt 1 \u03a6 c2 dt \u03c4 1 \u03a6 c2 t, 23 so we conclude that in an overdense region \u03b4\u03a6 0 clocks run slower. \u03b4t t \u03b4\u03a6 c2 24 But this implies that the universe has expanded less, and is thus denser than average and that must also mean that it is hotter since T a 1 dT da T a, 25 8 so we have \u03b4T T \u03b4a a . 26 But for a matter dominated universe a t t2 3 \u03b4a a 2 3 dt t . 27 Combining the three equations above we \ufb01nd \u03b4T T \u03b4a a 2 3 dt t 2 3 \u03b4\u03a6 c2 . 28 The physical interpretation is that because clocks run slower in an ovedense region \u03b4\u03a6 0 , the universe will be younger and thus e\ufb00ectively hotter \u03b4T 0. Note that this has the opposite sign of the gravitational redshift term above. Hence we learn that that the net temperature anisotropy generated from the Sachs Wolfe e\ufb00ect is \u03b4T T SW \u03b4T T time \u03b4T T grav 2 3 \u03b4\u03a6 c2 \u03b4\u03a6 c2 1 3 \u03b4\u03a6 c2 29 2.2.3 Measuring the Primordial Power Spectrum We can now understand why the dimensionless power spectrum 2 T \u21132C\u2113 is essentially \ufb02at at low \u2113 100. In order to relate eqn. 29 to the CMB power spectrum we need to do a bit of math. By expanding the potential into Fourier modes \u03b4\u03a6 x,t d3k 2\u03c0 3 \u03b4\u03a6 k,t eik x, 30 and recalling that the perturbed Poisson equation 2\u03b4\u03a6 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c10\u03b4 we have k2\u03b4\u03a6 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c10\u03b4 P\u03b4 k4P\u03a6 k , 31 where P\u03b4 is the power spectrum of density \ufb02uctuations. Expanding the net Sachs Wolfe temperature perturbation in eqn. 29 in spherical harmonics, and averaging over all possible observer positions yields, after some math C\u2113 a\u2113m 2 1 2\u03c0 H0 c 4 0 P\u03b4 k j\u2113 kx dk k2 , 32 where j\u2113 is a spherical Bessel function and x 2c H0. Assuming that in\ufb02ation gives rise to a power law primordial power spectrum P k Akn the expression above is analytic. It is then straightforward to show that the dimensionless power spectrum \u2113 \u2113 1 C\u2113 2\u03c0 const, 33 9 for the scale free case n 1, which are the initial conditions setup by in\ufb02ation which give rise to 2 \u03a6 k3P\u03a6 k 2\u03c02 const. Thus we see that the CMB power spectrum on large scales is directly related to the amplitude and slope of the primordial power spectrum 1 Figure 4 illustrates how the large angle \u2113 100 CMB power spectrum is used to measure the large scale linear theory matter power spectrum P k . 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 100 Wavenumber k hMpc 1 100 101 102 103 104 Pm k h 1Mpc 3 Planck TT Planck EE Planck SDSS DR7 LRG BOSS DR9 Ly forest DES Y1 cosmic shear Figure 4 The linear theory matter power spectrum at z 0 inferred from di\ufb00erent cosmological probes. From the Planck website. 2.3 Intermediate Angular Scales The Acoustic Peaks 2.3.1 The Sound Horizon Before we delve into the physics of the acoustic oscillations, we will calculate the characterstic length scale below which they operate, which is the sound horizon at the last scattering surface. This is the maximum distance which sound waves could travel and undergo coherent oscillations. By analogy with the particle horizon it is de\ufb01ned as the comoving distance rs tdec tdec 0 csdt a t , 34 1The so called integrated Sachs Wolfe e\ufb00ect makes this slightly more complicated, but we ignore that order 10 e\ufb00ect here. 10 which corresponds to the proper distance rs,prop adecrs tdec cstdec, where cs is the sound speed of the photon baryon \ufb02uid. The sound horizon therefore sets an upper limit to the wavelengths which acoustic waves could have at the epoch of recombination. In the homework you showed that the sound speed of the photon baryon \ufb02uid can be written cs P \u03c1 1 2 S c 3 3\u03c1b 4\u03c1\u03b3 1 1 2 c 3 1 R , 35 where R zdec 3\u03c1b 4\u03c1\u03b3 3\u2126b0\u03c1critc4 16\u03c3T4 0 1 zdec 3.045 104 \u2126b0h2 1 zdec 0.685, 36 for our reference parameters at zdec 1090, where \u03c3is the Stefan Boltzmann constant. Thus the speed of sound at the last scattering layer was cs 0.445c, whereas at earlier times when the universe is radiation dominated cs c 3 0.577c, which is the sound speed of a fully relativistic plasma. It is reasonable to just approximate cs c 3 in eqn. 34 , from which we \ufb01nd that rs rph 3 rs tdec tdec 0 csdt a t 1 3 tdec 0 cdt a t 158 cMpc, 37 or a proper size of dph 0.145 Mpc, which implies \u03b8s rs tdec dA tdec 1 zdec 0.7 \u2113s \u03c0 \u03b8s 280. 38 The size of the sound horizon at decoupling sets the characteristic angular scale of the acoustic peaks seen in the CMB power spectrum in Fig. 2. Inspection of the CMB power spectra in Fig. 2 indicates that the \ufb01rst peak in the power occurs at around this multipole, and that the other peaks in the spectrum occur at what appear to be harmonics of this multipole. The reason for this is that on small scales below the sound horizon, the amplitude of the Fourier modes exhibit temporal oscillations. Modes that are caught at maxima or minima of their oscillation at tdec correspond to peaks in the power. Because sound takes half as long to travel half as far, modes corresponding to peaks follow a harmonic relationship. Let s try to understand the physics of this in more detail. 2.3.2 Acoustic Oscillations Our analysis in this section will be necessarily approximate and aims to heuristically illustrate the basic physics behind the acoustic oscillations. The full treatment requires solving the Boltzmann equation in GR, which is beyond the scope of this course, although we sketch out the general approach in the next section. Unlike our analysis of the SW e\ufb00ect, on sub horizon scales causal processes related to the motion of the \ufb02uid in the DM potential wells, the compensating pressure gradients, and the resulting sound waves all have time to operate. Previously we discussed the coupled perurbations of dark matter and the tightly coupled photon baryon \ufb02uid before recombination in the context of linear perturbation theory. We 11 wrote down the following equations \u03b4c 2H \u03b4c 4 \u03c0G \u03c1c\u03b4c \u03c1b\u03b4b 4\u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c 39 \u03b4b 2H \u03b4b c2 sk2 a2 \u03b4b 4\u03c0G \u03c1c\u03b4c \u03c1b\u03b4b c2 sk2 a2 4\u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c, 40 where in the last equality we have assumed that the dark matter dominates the matter content. Since the dark matter dominates the gravity and the expansion rate, the universe is Einstein de Sitter and matter dominated, and eqn. 39 for the dark matter yields the growing solution \u03b4 a t which we studied before. Thus the 4\u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c in the baryon evolution equation can be thought of as an external driving term. Given the pressure term in the evolution equation for the baryons, the Jeans scale \u03bbJ csH 1 cH 1 is comparable to the sound horizon we expect to see acoustic oscillations. Since here we are focusing on the acoustic oscillations, the timescale of interest is the sound crossing time ts \u03bb cs a kcs , 41 and in our approximate treatment we can thus ignore the Hubble drag term in eqn. 40 relative to the other terms involving \u03b4b, i.e. 2H \u03b4b \u03b4b t \u03b4b \u03b4b t2 s 2 H \u03b4b k2c2 s a2 \u03b4b \u03b4b t2 s . 42 We can also use the perturbed Poisson equation for the dark matter 2\u03b4\u03a6c 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c1c\u03b4c k2\u03b4\u03a6c k,t 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c1c\u03b4c k,t , 43 to replace 4\u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c with k2\u03b4\u03a6c k,t a2. Thus we can \ufb01nally recast the evolution equation for the baryons eqn. 40 as \u03b4b k2c2 s a2 \u03b4b k2 a2 \u03b4\u03a6c. 44 Now note that at early times around recombination, the universe will be matter dominated and Einstein de Sitter with \u2126 tot 1, and in this regime we showed previously that linear theory predicts the potential perturbation does not evolve with time, so \u03b4\u03a6c k,t \u03b4\u03a6c k . The equation above is thus the equation of motion for a forced harmonic oscillator, with a constant forcing term. It admits solutions of the form \u03b4b k,\u03b7 \u03b4b k,0 \u03b4\u03a6c c2 s cos kcs\u03b7 1 kcs d\u03b4b d\u03b7 k,0 sin kcs\u03b7 \u03b4\u03a6c c2 s , 45 where we have introduced the conformal time as the new time variable, \u03b7 t 0 dt a t rs cs\u03b7, 46 12 and have noted that the sound horizon is equal to the product of the sound speed and the conformal time. This equation states that \u03b4b k,t oscillates around a zero point, \u03b4\u03a6c c2 s, with a frequency equal to \u03c9 kcs, and with amplitude and phase set by the initial conditions \u03b4b k,t 0 and d\u03b4b d\u03b7 k,t 0 . The motion of the photon baryon \ufb02uid will also source anisotropies due electron scattering. Using the perturbed continuity equation in k space \u03b4b 1 a \u03b4vb 0 ik vb a \u03b4b, 47 we can also obtain the time evolution of the corresponding baryon velocity perturbations vb k,t ik k2 d\u03b4b d\u03b7 icsk k \u03b4b k,0 \u03b4\u03a6c c2 s sin kcs\u03b7 ik k2 d\u03b4b d\u03b7 k,0 cos kcs\u03b7 . 48 Note that there is a phase di\ufb00erence of \u03c0 2 between the velocity and density perturbations, as is characteristic of a longitudinal acoustic wave. How can we relate these density and velocity perturbations to the CMB temperature anisotropy T T? First note that, as discussed at the beginning of 2.1, the CMB anistropy is sourced by multiple terms, namely the gravitational or SW e\ufb00ect, ansitropy due to baryon \ufb02uctua tions, and Doppler shifts sourced by velocity \ufb02uctuations T T k,t T T grav T T \u03c1 T T v \u03b4\u03a6 k,t c2 \u03b4b k,t 3 1 3 vb c , 49 where we have included the Sachs Wolfe gravitational redshift term T T grav \u03b4\u03a6 k,t c2, and used the relationship T T \u03c1 \u03b4b 3 that we derived in eqn. 16 . For the Doppler velocity perturbation, we have used the fact that all three spatial directions should have the same rms value of the velocity, and so the Doppler line of sight contribution resulting from the motion of the \ufb02uid is just T T v v c vb 3 . 50 Let s focus on the \ufb01rst two terms \ufb01rst, namely the sum of the gravitational and density contributions to the anisotropy. These two terms typically called the e\ufb00ective temperature \ufb02uctuation re\ufb02ect the observed temperature \ufb02uctuation due to gravitational redshifting of photons as they climb out of potential wells and compression rarefaction of the gas T T e\ufb00 T T grav T T \u03c1 \u03b4\u03a6 k,t c2 \u03b4b k,t 3 . 51 Plugging in our solution for \u03b4b from eqn. 45 above we obtain T T e\ufb00 \u03b4\u03a6c c2 \u03b4b k,0 3 \u03b4\u03a6c 3c2 s cos kcs\u03b7 1 3kcs d\u03b4b d\u03b7 k,0 sin kcs\u03b7 \u03b4\u03a6c 3c2 s . 52 13 Now using cs c 3 1 R , we can write this solution as T T e\ufb00 \u03980 k,0 1 R \u03a8 cos kcs\u03b7 1 kcs d\u03980 d\u03b7 k,0 sin kcs\u03b7 R\u03a8, 53 where we have introduced the new variables \u0398 0 \u03b4b 3 and \u03a8 \u03b4\u03a6c. Likewise, using eqn. 50 the Doppler component of the perturbation can be written T T v 3cs c \u03980 k,0 1 R \u03a8 c2 sin kcs\u03b7 3 k d\u03980 d\u03b7 k,0 cos kcs\u03b7 . 54 For the moment, let us focus on the e\ufb00ective temperature \ufb02uctuation, i.e. the gravity plus density term, which turns out to dominate the power. It is clear from the form of eqn. 53 , that the form of the acoustic oscillations is governed by the two initial conditions \u03980 k,0 and d\u03980 d\u03b7 k,0 , 55 at time \u03b7 0. Inspection of eqn. 53 begs the question why should there be any acoustic oscillations at all? When we observe the CMB at decoupling, we are basically taking a snapshot of the radiation \ufb01eld at \u03b7 \u03b7dec, which amounts to evaluating T T e\ufb00 \u03b7 \u03b7dec . If we superpose a large collection of modes with di\ufb00erent wavelengths wavenumbers k and arbitrary phase i.e. set by the values of the initial conditions \u0398 0 k,0 and d\u03980 d\u03b7 k,0 , this should not result in a preferred scale that produces peaks in the power spectrum. Why do we observe peaks in the CMB power spectrum? To answer this question we \ufb01rst need to to be more clear about what we mean by initial conditions , that is what time is \u03b7 0? The initial conditions for these acoustic oscillations should be set at the time at which causal physics begins to operate, in other words what we mean by \u03b7 0 is actually the time at which a given mode entered the horizon. It turns out that in\ufb02ation can only excite so called isentropic perturbations for which the ratio of the matter and radiation is a constant at horizon entry. These correspond to pure curvature \ufb02uctuations or perturbations to the metric on super horizon scales. They are called isentropic because a constant ratio of radiation to matter implies that the entropy per baryon s nB is constant. The alternative are so called isocurvature perturbations for which the entropy per baryon can \ufb02uctuate from point to point. This is achieved by for example allowing the baryon density to \ufb02uctuate on a \ufb01xed radiation backround. We won t be able to go into more detail about how these \ufb02uctuations are classi\ufb01ed, but the upshot is that isentropic \ufb02uctuations only excite the cosine term in eqn. 53 at horizon entry, in other words we have \u03980 k,0 const d\u03980 d\u03b7 k,0 0, 56 which corresponds to an initial metric perturbation, whereas isocurvature \ufb02uctuations excite the sine mode at horizon entry, which corresponds to zero initial metric perturbation. Now 14 recall the de\ufb01nition of the conformal time \u03b7 \u03b7 t 0 dt a t rph t c\u03b7. 57 Thus for a given mode k, horizon crossing occurs at rph \u03b7h k c\u03b7h k 2\u03c0 k \u03b7h k 2\u03c0 ck. 58 The important thing to note is that the phase of an acoustic wave at horizon crossing is phase kcs\u03b7h k 1, 59 is a constant of order unity which is independent of k. Thus, the zero point of the phase of every mode can be consistently set at horizon crossing, such that e\ufb00ectively all the modes are setup with some initial amplitude of the cosine term in eqn. 53 . That fact that in\ufb02ation lines up the phases allows us to now understand what gives rise to the peaks in the CMB power spectrum. Given a collection of modes with wavenumber k, there will be a speci\ufb01c set of modes that have exactly the right phase at \u03b7dec such that they result in a compression or a rarefaction at the time of decoupling when the CMB is released, as illustrated in Fig. 5. The lowest \u2113 acoustic peak in the CMB power spectrum, corresponding to the largest wavelength mode, will occur for the mode which has one half wavelength equal to the sound horizon k1rs k1cs\u03b7dec \u03c0, 60 where in the last equality we used that the sound horizon is just rs cs\u03b7dec. The other higher \u2113 and higher k peaks in the CMB power are modes that are integer multiples of k1, which will also result in maximum compression or rarefaction at decoupling kncs\u03b7dec n\u03c0 kn n\u03c0 rs nk1, 61 This is analogous to the condition for the resonant frequencies for standing waves in a pipe which is closed at each end, such that the pressure perturbation achieves maximum compression rarefaction at the boundaries, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Since the power spectrum is e\ufb00ectively the square of the temperature perturbation \u03b4T T, both maxima hot spots and minima cold spots give rise to peaks in the power spectrum, as illustrated by Fig. 6 Now that we have understood the basic physical picture for the origin of the acoustic peaks, we can gain further insight into the shape of the CMB power spectrum with just a little more work. We argued that only the cosine term is excited, thus T T e\ufb00 \u03980 k,0 1 R \u03a8 c2 cos kcs\u03b7 R\u03a8 c2 . 62 To determine the initial condition \u0398 0 k,0 we consider the behavior of the equation above 15 as \u03b7 0. This corresponds to horizon entry, at which time the causal physics that gives rise to the acoustic oscillations and the Doppler shifts that result from electron scattering, will not have time to operate. That is, at the earliest times our solution needs to be equal to the Sachs Wolfe anistropy that we derived previously, which implies \u03980 k,0 \u03a8 c2 1 3 \u03a8 c2 \u03980 k,0 2 3 \u03a8 c2 . 63 Recall that \u03a8 is a constant in time recall density perutrbations grow as a, but potentials are constant if the universe is matter dominated. So we can \ufb01nally write the solution for the e\ufb00ective temperature anisotropy T T e\ufb00 \u03b7dec \u03a8 3c2 1 3R cos krs R\u03a8 c2 . 64 For the Doppler term we have T T v \u03b7dec \u03a8 3c2 1 3R 1 R 1 2 sin krs , 65 where, similar to our analysis for T T e\ufb00, we used the initial conditions in eqns. 56 and 63 . Therefore, the amplitude of the temperature \ufb02uctuation given by a Fourier mode with wavenumber k is determined by \u03a8, R, and the phase krs of the acoustic wave at the last scattering surface. Using these solutions we can explain multiple observed properties of the CMB power spec trum Assyemtric peak heights Evaluating T T e\ufb00 at the peaks which have k n\u03c0 rs we see that T T e\ufb00 \u03a8 3c2 1 6R n odd \u03a8 3c2 n even , 66 and the odd harmonics will have higher amplitude than the even harmonics. Inspection of Fig. 8 illustrates that this is indeed the case for the magenta curve labeled SW which shows the T T e\ufb00 contribution. This enhancement of the odd peaks relative to the even peaks occurs because the odd peaks correspond to compressions of the sound waves, and the inerita of the baryons as quanti\ufb01ed by the Rfactor enhances these relative to the rarefactions. The Doppler anisotropy should be \u03c0 2 out of phase with the e\ufb00ective temperature anistropy, because of the cos krs vs sin krs , which we see is the case in Fig. 8 blue curve . Furthemore, the amplitude at the peaks of the Doppler term will not be as large as the e\ufb00ective temperature term. As such, in the CMB power spectrum C\u2113 the Doppler term peaks \ufb01ll the valleys between the peaks of e\ufb00ective temperature rather than appearing as peaks themselves.

Given a collection of modes, only a special set will have traveled the right distance to result in a maximal compression rarefaction at the time of decoupling, illustrated by the squiggly orange line. cosmological parameters which are illustrated in Fig. 9. Because the sound horizon rs can be computed from \ufb01rst principles, it amounts to a standard ruler. Given that we can also calculate the redshift of decoupling from \ufb01rst principles, we can use this standard ruler rs and the known redshift of decoupling zdec to determine the angular diameter distance to the surface of last scattering DA zdec . Because the angular diameter distance varies considerably for an open, \ufb02at, or closed universe k 0,1, 1, the location of the \ufb01rst peak alone determines the the geometry of the metric. Information about \u2126 b0 is encoded in the relative heights of the peaks. Since eqn. 66 indicates that the height of the odd peaks depends on R \u2126b0, whereas the height of the even peaks are not sensitive to Rand hence, the relative heights of the peaks is sensitive to \u2126 b0. 2.4 Small Angular Scales 2.4.1 The Last Scattering Layer The CMB comes to us from the last scattering surface at z 1100. Recall how we estimated the redshift of decoupling.

Figure from Hu arXiv 0802.3688. reaction freezes out \u0393T T ne\u03c3Tc H T , 67 where ne is the electron density and \u03c3T is the Thompson scattering cross section. A more accurate derivation of the redshift of decoupling, which you will explore in the homework, can be obtained by de\ufb01ning an optical depth of Thomson scattering from an observer at z 0 to a surface at a redshift z \u03c4 z z 0 ne\u03c3T dl dzdz, 68 where dl is an in\ufb01tesimal element of proper distance along the light cone to redshift z. But ne Xe\u03b7n\u03b3, where Xe is the ionized fraction, and \u03b7 is the baryon to photon ration, and n\u03b3 is the number density of photons, so one can use Xe z computed from a full non equilibrium i.e. Boltzmann recombination calculation to determine \u03c4 z . The optical depth is a measure of the number of mean free paths traversed between two distances, here between the observer at redshift z 0 and some location z. Thus the probability that a photon was last scattered in the redshift interval z dz 2 can be expressed in terms of the visibility function P z e \u03c4d\u03c4 dz, 69 which is shown in Figure 10. This plot of the visibility function clearly indicates that CMB photons were not last scattered at a single redshift, but rather over a range of redshifts. The maximum of the visibility function occurs at a redshift of z 1090, which we identify as 18 the redshift of decoupling. It has half maxima lying at redshifts of z 1178 and z 983, corresponding to a redshift interval of z 195. For the benchmark cosmology, the redshift of the maximum of the visibility function correspondeds to an age of the universe of t 370,000 years after the Big Bang, and most of the photons were last scattered between the epochs t 320,000 and t 440,000 years. Although the last scattering surface is not strictly speaking a surface, but rather a volume with a \ufb01nite thickeness, it is nevertheless su\ufb03ciently thin that we can imagine it as acting like a kind of photon barrier, similar to the photosphere of the Sun. No information carried by photons originating from z 1100 can reach the Earth, as the photons involved will be scattered many times. Let us work out the increment of comoving radial distance coordinate corresponding to the thickness of the last scattering layer. At large redshifts, we can neglect the vaccum energy relative to the matter density, and so an in\ufb01testimal interval of line of sight comoving distance is dr cdt a cdz H z cH 1 0 dz z3 2\u21261 2 m0 . 70 Taking the thickness of the last scattering layer to correspond to the redshift interval z 1178 983 195 at z 1090 as we computed above, the corresponding comoving radial distance is r 38 Mpc. 71 Although this is a distance along the line of sight, it is useful to calculate the angle on the sky it would project to, or equivalently the multipole \u2113 2\u03c0 \u03b8 \u03b8 9.5 arcmin \u2113 2\u03c0 \u03b8 2270. 72 On comoving scales less than r 40 Mpc, corresponding to angles smaller than about \u03b8 10 arcmin or multipoles greater than \u2113 1000, because of the \ufb01nite thickness of the last scattering layer, we expect the observed CMB to result from a number of independent \ufb02uctuations along the line of sight through the last scattering layer. Consequently, the ran dom superposition of these perturbations leads to a statistical reduction in the amplitude of the observed intensity \ufb02uctuations by a factor of roughly N 1 2, where N is the number of \ufb02uctuations of a given size probed along the line of sight, i.e. N r \u03bb. The power spectrum of the CMB will thus be suppressed on this scale. This suppression is essentially just geometric, i.e. it results from the fact that the CMB cannot be treated as a thin surface for \ufb02uctuations comparable to the thickenss of the surface. This suppression of \ufb02uctuations for \u2113 1000 can be seen in the CMB power spectrum in Fig. ??. There is in fact a second source of suppression known as Silk Damping, due to the fact that photons can di\ufb00use out of overdensities via Thompson scattering. Analogous to free streaming, small scale \ufb02uctua tions will be suppressed. 19 3 The Boltzmann Equation Predicting the power spectrum of CMB anisotropies is a challenging task. Because it involves \ufb02uctuations in the relativistic photon baryon \ufb02uid on scales comparble to or in excess of the horizon, GR is required. The full apparatus of perturbing the Einstein gravitational \ufb01eld equations yields equations that are analogous to the equations we derived when studying linear structure formation in the Newtonian approximation. As we discussed previously when discussing transfer functions, additional complications arises because components like the photons at decoupling when the mean free path becomes large , neutrinos, or dark matter if there is signi\ufb01cant free streaming do not behave like a \ufb02uid and so the full Boltzmann equation must be solved. By considering the Boltzmann equation in GR, linearizing it, and then taking moments to derive equations like the \ufb02uid equations, one obtains a set of coupled di\ufb00erential equations for the Fourier mode amplitudes of the various quantities of interest \u0398 ik\u00b5\u0398 \u03a6 ik\u00b5\u03a8 \u03c4 \u00b5vb \u0398 vb a avb ik\u03a8 \u03c4 R vb 3i\u03981 . 73 Here \u0398 T T is the Fourier transform of the perturbation to the photon distribution function, \u0398 x,\u02c6p,t , de\ufb01ned by f x,p, \u02c6p,t exp p T t 1 \u0398 x,\u02c6p,t 1 1 , 74 thus \u0398 x,\u02c6p,t is the fractional temperature perturbation for photons propgating in a given direction \u02c6p. The quantity \u00b5 is the cosine of the angle between the wavevector k and the photon propagation direction \u02c6p, R 3 \u03c1b 4\u03c1r , and we have simpli\ufb01ed the equation by assuming that Thomson scattering is isotropic. The time derivatives here are with respect to the conformal time de\ufb01ned byd\u03b7 dt a t . The quantities \u03a8 and \u03a6 are new, and result from treating the situation in GR. Basically, two perturbations to the metric describe the e\ufb00ect of weak gravitational \ufb01elds resulting from the \ufb02uctuations for so called scalar peturbations, where \u03a8 corresponds to what we usually think of as the Newtonian gravitational potential, and \u03a6 corresponds to a perturbation of the spatial curvature. It is instructive to compare these equations to what we derived previously for Newtonian perturbation theory \u03b4 t 1 a \u03b4v 0 Continuity 75 \u03b4v t H\u03b4v 1 a \u03b4\u03a6 c2 s a \u03b4 Euler 76 2\u03b4\u03a6 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c10\u03b4 Poisson . 77 Although the Boltzmann version looks complicated, every term has an immediately clear physical interpretation. The left hand side of the \ufb01rst equation for \u0398 is a convective de rivtative, representing photon free streaming . We can think of this as the analog of the 20 continuity equation for the photons, but with source terms on the right hand side. The \ufb01rst two terms on the right hand side are the time dilation and gravitational redshift e\ufb00ects that give rise to the Sachs Wolfe e\ufb00ect, and describe the change in the energy of the photons as they propagate through a perturbed spactime. The last term on the right hand side repre sents the redistribution of photons by Thomson scattering, which brings in the optical depth, \u03c4, and includes a Doppler boost from the velocity of the baryon \ufb02uid. The second equation is the force equation for the baryon velocity, which we knew as the Euler equation in the Newtonian analysis. It has the same form, except that it includes a second terms on the right hand side to represent momentum tranfer to the baryons from the scattered photons. This is quite nasty, as it involves \u0398 1, which is the dipole moment of the temperature \ufb01eld \u0398 T T. So we have \u0398 ik\u00b5\u0398 convective derivative \u03a6 ik\u00b5\u03a8 SW e\ufb00ect \u03c4 \u00b5vb \u0398 Thomson scattering vb a avb accel. Hubble drag ik\u03a8 potential gradient \u03c4 R vb 3i\u03981 generalized pressure . 78 The natural approach to solving these equations is to start in Fourier space and consider a density \ufb02uctuation of a given wavevector k. If we can work out how this appears as an induced temperature \ufb02uctuation on the CMB sky then, becuase the equations above are linear, the problem can be solved by the principle of superposition. The wavevector k sets a natural polar axis, and the temperature anisotropy corresponds to knowing the photon phase space distribution at our location in space, that is, the distribution of the photons in energy and as a function of angle with respect tok. Evolving this function is hard principally because of the coupling between radiation and matter set by Thomson scattering. Scattering a beam of photons that come from a given direction will tend to push the electron in the opposite direction, so a net force requires an anisotropic photon distribution. In fact, it is clear that the force must be proportional to the dipole monent of the distribution function which is the origin of the \u0398 1 in the equation above. This creates an obvious problem it couples the evolution of the number of photons traveling in a given direction\u02c6p with knowledge of the whole distribution. Mathematically, we have an integro di\ufb00erential equation. In practice, rather than trying to numerically solve for the photon distribution function normally denoted by \u0398 , we can carry out a multipole transform to work with \u0398 \u2113. The integro di\ufb00erential equation then becomes a set of equations that couple di\ufb00erent \u2113 values. These have to be solved as a large set of equations since the CMB power spectrum contains signal extending beyond \u2113 1000 , and when this is done we will have to integrate over k space. It took many years to solve this numerical challenge, and even then the computations were very slow. A key development in cosmology was the development of CMBFAST in 1996 by Seljak and Zaldarriaga, who \ufb01gured out a trick to perform the required Boltzmann equation integrations much faster than was previously possible. Their public release of this code allowed computation of the CMB angular power spectrum su\ufb03ciently rapidly that a large range of models could be investigated by non specialists. We discussed these Boltzmann solvers previously when we discussed transfer functions in linear structure formation. There 21 are now other codes that supercede CMBFAST in accuracy and ease of use like CMBEASY, CAMB, CLASS, and PyCosmo. 22 48 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN FEBRUARY 2004 BRYAN CHRISTIE DESIGN COSMIC HARMONICS THE SOUND SPECTRUM of the early universe had overtones much like a musical instrument s. If you blow into a pipe, the sound corresponds to a wave with maximum air compression blue at the mouthpiece and maximum rarefaction red at the end piece. But the sound also has a series of overtones with shorter wavelengths that are integer fractions of the fundamental wavelength. The wavelengths of the first, second and third overtones are one half, one third and one fourth as long. SOUND WAVES also oscillated in the plasma of the early universe. After inflation, the fundamental wave compressed some regions of plasma and rarefied others, causing the temperature of the CMB radiation in the regions to reach maximum blue and minimum red values by the time of recombination. The overtones oscillated two, three or more times as quickly, causing smaller regions to reach maximum and minimum CMB temperatures at the time of recombination.

By 1929 he had obtained Cepheid distances for 24 galaxies with red shifts and claimed that these displayed a linear relationship v Hd. He cited theoretical predictions from relativistic cosmology that redshift or velocity should increase linearly with distance in an expanding Universe as a possible explanation. At the time, Hubble estimated H 500 km s 1 Mpc 1, because his calibration of Cepheid luminosities was in error. The best modern value is close to 70 km s 1 Mpc 1.I n t h i s a n d t h e f o l l o w i n g f e w l e c t u r e s w e w i l l work out the mathematical description of expanding spacetime that leads to Hubbble s law. 1 Hubble Expansion and Scale Factora t Figure 1 Expansion of the Universe.

Now we begin to mathematically codify the idea of an expanding Universe. Consider a distribution of galaxies that is made to expand uniformly, in the same way as if a picture of the pattern was undergoing continuous magni\ufb01cation as illustrated in Fig. 1. Mathematically, this means that all position vectors at timet are just scaled versions of their values at a reference time t0 x t a t x t0 . 1 Di erentiating this with respect tot gives x t a t x t0 a t a t x t , 2 or a velocity proportional to distance, as required.

To describe the Universe as a whole we make no attempts to incorporate discrete structures like galaxies or clusters. We imagine all matter in the Universe smeared out into an idealized, smooth \ufb02uid that de\ufb01nes the overall kinematics of the system of galaxies. The mathematical framework for the standard model is based on theCosmological Princi ple,w h i c hi st h eh y p o t h e s i st h a t ,o ns u c i e n t l yl a r g es c a l e s1 the Universe can be considered spatially homogeneous and isotropic. Philosophically this can be thought of as a generaliza tion of the Copernican Principle,t h a tt h e r ei sn o t h i n gs p e c i a lo rp r i v e l e g e da b o u to u r place in the universe. The cosmological principle can also be stated as the existence of a fundamental observer at each location, to whom the Universe appears isotropic. The concept of a fundamental observer is required because two observers at the same point, but in relative motion, cannot both see the surrounding Universe as isotropic. The fundamental observer thus implies a cosmological rest frame at each location in space and this rest frame is de\ufb01ned to be one that is comoving with the Universe s gloabl expansion, or being in the Hubble \ufb02ow . More speci\ufb01cally, imagine the expanding universe \ufb01lled with fundamental observers each at di erent locations, all of whom are at rest with respect to the matter in their vicinity. We can envisage them as each sitting on a di erent galaxy, and so receding from each other with the general Hubble expansion. Actually this is not quite right, since each galaxy has a peculiar velocity with respect to its neighbors of a few hundred km s 1 which are sourced by density \ufb02uctuations. We really need to imagine an idealized universe where the matter density is uniform. The fundamental observers give us a way of de\ufb01ning a universal time coordinate, even though relativity tells us that such a thing is impossible in general. We can de\ufb01ne a cosmological timet, which is the time measured by the clocks of these observers i.e. t is the proper time measured by an observer at rest with respect to the local matter distribution and hence comoving with the expansion of the Universe.

At every point in spacetime there is ametric ag e o m e t r y t h a ti sd e t e r m i n e d by the gravitational \ufb01eld at that point. Given a geometry, we can calculate the equations of motion. It was shown in 1935 by Robertson Walker that the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy requires the metric to take the form, in spherical polar coordinates, ds2 c2dt2 a2 t dr2 S2 k r d 2 s i n2 d 2 c2dt2 a2 t dr2 S2 k r d 2 , 4 where Sk r 8 R0 sin r R0 k 1 rk 0 R0 sinh r R0 k 1 5 This is known as the Robertson Walker RW metric or the Friedmann Robertson Walker metric . Here a t i st h escale factorintroduced in 1w h i c hd e t e r m i n e st h eo v e r a l ls c a l eo f the spatial part of the metric and thus describes how distances expand or contract with time. The quantity k 1 ,0 ,o r 1i st h ecurvature constant,a n dd 2 d 2 s i n2 d 2 is the familiar solid angle from spherical coordinates, andr is a time independent comoving radial coordinate ! comoving observers have the samer at all times, even if the Universe expands or contracts. The quantityR0 is the radius of curvatureof the universe at the present epoch. The quantityds2 is an invariant interval between two neighboring events in spacetime sep arated by dx\u00b5, \u00b5 0 , 1, 2, 3 . In the language of GR this interval ds2 can be written as ds2 X \u00b5 g\u00b5 dx\u00b5dx , 6 where g\u00b5 is themetric tensor a symmetricN N matrix, whereN 4i st h ed i m e n s i o n of the spacetime , which expresses the notion of distance between spacetime points. The metric determines the trajectories of free falling bodies they move along geodesics of the spacetime and also how light propagates in curved space light travels along so called null geodesics with ds2 0 . T h ei n d i c e s\u00b5 and run over the time coordinate labelled 0 and the 3 space coordinates. In general,g\u00b5 will be a complicated function of space and time with o diagonal terms that make the separation of space and time impossible. However, the metric tensor simpli\ufb01es enormously when space is homogeneous and isotropic. Finally, note that the coordinate system used above is not the only possibility. For example if we peform a change of varaibles Sk r , the metric for a homogenous, isotropic, three dimensional space can be written ds2 c2dt2 a2 t d 2 1 k R0 2 2d 2 . 7 3 which has the advantage that the 2d 2 terms looks like what one gets in spherical coordi nates for Euclidean i.e. \ufb02at space. 2.3 Building Intuition For Metrics Whether we use the term or not, we are all familiar with metrics. For example, using the Pythagorean theorem we can write the distance between two points in ordinary 3D space as s2 x2 y2 z2, 8 which de\ufb01nes the so called Euclidean metric. In the special theory of relativity this becomes generalized to the distance between two spacetime points s2 ct 2 x2 y2 z2. 9 We can write the in\ufb01nitesimal version of this as ds2 X \u00b5 \u00b5 dx\u00b5dx , 10 where the only nonzero components of the metric tensor are the diagonal terms 1, 1, 1, 1 Minkowski spacetime , and where it is understood thatdx0 cdt.I f t h e t w o e v e n t s a r e connected by a signal travelling atv,s u c ht h a tdxi vidt then ds2 c2dt2 1 v2 c2 . 11 Al i g h tp u l s ee x p a n d si nas p h e r ea tt h es p e e do fl i g h t ,s ov c and thus it travels along a null geodesicwith ds2 0, such that the events can be connected by a light ray. In spherical coordinates x r sin cos y r sin sin z r cos , 12 where r is the radial coordinate, is the polar angle, and is the azimuthal angle ds2 c2dt2 dr2 r2 d 2 s i n2 d 2 . 13 Thus the coordinate system changed but the metric still describes \ufb02at space. In contrast, consider the surface of a 2D sphere of radiusR embedded in a \ufb02at 3D space. The spatial part of the metric would then be ds2 R2 d 2 s i n2 d 2 . 14 It is easy to show that this represents a closed surface with \ufb01nite area and no boundary. We 4 \u02c7 Figure 2 Examples of di erent spacetime ge ometries described by the FRW metric. In white is an equilateral triangle. Black arrows indicate how initially parallel geodesics will behave.

Whereas the equation above is for a 2D spherical surface which we can visualize as being embedded in 3 space , eqn. 4 actually corresponds to a 3D spherical volume which, just like the 2D sphere, is spatially closed and has a \ufb01nite volume. It is possible to convert this to the metric for the 2D analog of a constant negative curvature surface by considering an imaginary radius of curvatureR ! iR.I n t h i s c a s ek 1a n d the metric takes the form ds2 dr2 1 r R 2 r2d 2. 17 5 Hilbert proved that a two dimensional surface of uniform negative curvature cannot be em bedded in a three dimensional Euclidean space, so this is not something you can easily visualize. Maybe that is not so surprising, since the hyperbolic space described by this metric has in\ufb01nite area. The saddle shape illustrated in Fig 2 has uniform negative curvature only in the central region, near the seat of the saddle. Finally, the Euclidean case of zero curvature is the casek 0w h i c hy o uc a nt h i n ko fa s the limit where the radius of curvatureR !1 . As we will see observations indicate that k 0 to very high precision, so for the purposes of this course we will work primarily with the Euclidean case. 3 Proper Distance, Redshift, and Hubble Drag 3.1 Proper Distance Consider a galaxy su ciently far away from us that that we can consider the Universe as uniform on this scale and thus well described by the RW metric. In an expanding universe, the distance between two objects is increasing with time as illustrated by the simple example in 1. The proper distance rp between two points is equal to the length of the spacelike geodesic a geodesic withdt 0 between them at some instant in cosmic timet,s u c ht h a t we can considerdt 0a n dt h es c a l ef a c t o rt ob e\ufb01 x e da tt h ev a l u ea t , which implies ds2 a2 t dr2 ds a t dr 18 where we have assumed the angle , i se q u a lt oac o n s t a n ta l o n gt h i sg e o d e s i cs u c ht h a t d 2 0 . The proper distancerp is obtained by integrating over the radial comoving coordinater rp t a t Z r 0 dr a t r. 19 Thus the proper distancerp t i saf u n c t i o no ft i m eb u tt h ec o m o v i n gd i s t a n c er is not. The rate of change of proper distance between any two points is vp t rp t a t r a arp H t rp, 20 where we have used the time dependent Hubble expanstion rateH t a a.T h e e q u a t i o n above implies that at any timet there is a linear relation between the proper distance to ag a l a x ya n di t sr e c e s s i o ns p e e dw h i c hi sr e f e r r e dt oa st h eHubble \ufb02ow. At the present time t t0 we de\ufb01ne H t0 H0, which has the observationally determined value of 68 2k ms 1 Mpc 1. Again this idea of a constant comoving distancer,t h es c a l ef a c t o r a t , and the resulting linear relation between velocityvp and proper distance rp are just repetitions of the discussion in 1o ft h ee x p a n d i n gp i c t u r ep a t t e r n ,b u tn o we x p r e s s e dm o r e formally in terms of the metric. 6 3.2 Light Propagation and Redshift To analyse the observations of light from distant ob jects we need to account for the fact that the wavelength of the light gets stretched or, equivalently, the photons lose energy due to the expansion of the universe, which is known asredshift.W e c a n w o r k o u t h o w r e d s h i f t relates to a t . Let us consider the time it takes light to travel along a null geodesic with ds2 0 . S u p p o s et h el i g h ti se m i t t e da tt tem at positionr and travels to position 0 where it arrives at timet tobs. Note that because of isotropy and homogeneity we can always choose to orient our coordinate system so that and will be constant. Since photons travel along null geodesics withds2 0w eh a v e cdt a t dr Z tobs tem cd t a t Z 0 r dr r. 21 Now let us also consider a second signal emitted just slightly later attem tem and received at tobs tobs r Z tobs tobs tem tem cd t a t , Z tobs tem cd t a t Z tem tem tem cd t a t Z tobs tobs tobs cd t a t Z tobs tem cd t a t c tem a tem c tobs a tobs . 22 Since r is a comoving coordinate which by construction has not changed with time, both eqn. 21 and eqn. 22 are equal tor. This implies that tobs a tobs a tem tem. Now imagine that the time interval we considered tem to be at di erent crests of an electro magnetic wave so that tem can be identi\ufb01ed with the periodTem 1 em em c.W e c a n also choose tobs to be the present day so that the scale factora tobs 1 ,w h i c hi sh o ww e generally normalize the scale factor at the present epoch. The previous equation can then be rewritten as obs a tem 1 em 1 z em 23 where we have de\ufb01neda tem 1 1 z . The expansion of the Universe implies light must redshift! 3.3 Peculiar Velocity and Hubble Drag As we will see later, small perturbations in the background energy density distribution cause the growth of structures, which in turn induce velocities that deviate from pure expansion. These velocities with respect to the cosmological rest frame of the fundamental observers are called peculiar velocities. 7 znnnnnnnnnrn vvvennnn n unnr rredshiftiz.no blueshift Zeo The proper velocity with respect to a fundamental observer at the origin isvp drp dt, where vp drp dt d dt a t r t a t r t a t r t vexp vpec 24 where we have used eqn. 19 forrp and the comoving distancer t is now a function of time beacuse of the presence of a peculiar velocity, such that r t i st h ec o m o v i n gp e c u l i a r velocity anda t r t c o n v e r t st h i st oap r o p e rp e c u l i a rv e l o c i t yvpec.

Now imagine that there is a particle which is moving with a proper peculiar velocityvpec. It will gradually overtake objects as it moves, but since in an expanding universe objects farther away from it are moving faster, its velocity will decelerate relative to fundamental observers comoving with the local Hubble \ufb02ow. To be more precise consider the diagram in Fig. 3. A fundamental observerO observes a particle X traveling with peculiar velocityvpec t . An in\ufb01tesimal interval dt of time later at timet dt the particle X has traveled to a new locationd away fromO and has a new peculiar velocity vpec t dt . The quesiton we aim to answer is how doesvpec t c h a n g e with time? To answer this consider that from the perspective ofO,t h ep a r t i c l eP has no forces acting on it, and because special relativity applies over these in\ufb01testimal intervals we are considering, P cannot have been accelerated, and since the proper velocities are physical velocities we must havevp t vp t dt w h e r evp is the proper velocity measured byO. At timet vp t vpec t , 25 since there is no expansion contribution sinceO is a fundamental observer moving with the Hubble \ufb02ow andr t 0 t h ec o m o v i n gs e p a r a t i o nb e t w e e nt h ep a r t i c l eX and O a tt 0 . 8 Whereas at timet dt vp t dt vexp t dt vpec t dt H t dt d vpec t dt H t vpec t dt vpec t dt . 26 Here we have written the expansion term in terms of the Hubble constant, and in the last approximation we have usedd vpec t dt and Taylor expanded working only to linear order in small quantities. Equatingvp t vp t dt , we \ufb01nd vpec t dt vpec H t vpec t dt 27 or dvpec dt Hvpec. 28 Thus we see that from the perspective ofO,t h epeculiar velocity of particleX decreases with time, which is known asHubble drag. We can rearrange this equation slightly to obtain dvpec dt dvpec da a a avpec ! dvpec da 1 avpec. 29 Taking the dot product of the equation above withvvec one obtains dvpec da vpec 1 2 dv2 pec da 1 av2 pec ! dv2 pec v2 pec 2da a 30 It is easy to show that this implies ln vpec vpec,0 ln a a0 3 1 or vpec a 1. 32 One can also show that the relativistic generalization of this is thatp a 1 where p is the momentum. For a particle moving atv c,w ea l r e a d yd e r i v e dt h i s . . . i t sc a l l e dr e d s h i f t ! In other words, since photon momentum depends on wavelength, the redshifting of light amounts to the samep a 1 reduction in momentum. Whereas our prevous deriviation of the redshift treated light as an electromagnetic wave with crests and troughs, this derivation in terms of momentum also applies to the quantum mechanical treatment of light as photons. 4 Horizons The size of a causally connected patch of space is determined by how far light can travel in a certain amount of time. As we mentioned previously in 3.2, light travels along null geodesics with ds2 0 and we have from the FRW metric cdt a t dr, 33 9 null geodesics where t is cosmic time,r is the comoving distance, and we orient our coordinate system to have d 2 0 . I nt h i sc o n t e x ti ti sc o n v e n i e n tt om a k eac h a n g eo fv a r i a b l e sw h i c hd e \ufb01 n e s the conformal time d dt a t . 34 Integrating both sides, we see that along a null geodesic one then has r c , 35 where the plus sign corresponds to outgoing photons and the minus sign to incoming photons. The advantage of the conformal time is that in these coordinates the propagation of light in the FRW metric looks the same as it does in Minkowski spacec t x,n a m e l yl i g h tr a y s travel along straight lines at 45 angles inr coordinates assumingc 1a si sc u s t o m a r y in relativity , whereas had we used the cosmic timet the light cones in a curved spacetime would be curved. We are now in a position to de\ufb01ne two di erent types of cosmological horizons. One which limits the distances at which past events can be observed and another which limits the distances at which it will ever be possible to in\ufb02uence events in the future. Because signals cannot travel faster than the speed of light, these horizons then also determine the sizes of causally connected regions of spacetime. 4.1 Particle Horizon According to eqn. 35 , the maximum comoving distance that light can travel between two conformal times 1 and 2 1 is simply r c . Hence if the Big Bang started with a singularity at ti 0, then the largest comoving distance from which an observer at timet will be able to receive a signal traveling at the speed of light is given by rph c i Z t ti cdt a t , 36 which is known as thecomoving particle horizon.T h e s i z e o f t h e p a r t i c l e h o r i z o n a t time can be visualised by the intersection of the past light cone of an observerp with the spacelike hypersurface i.e. constant time i, which corresponds to the Big Bang as illustrated in Figure 4.

Notice that every observer has his or her own particle horizon. 4.2 Event Horizon Just as there are past events that we cannot see now, there may be regions of space in the future that we will never be able to in\ufb02uence. In comoving coordinates, the largest distance from which an observer at some future timetf will receive signals emitted at any time later 10 than an earlier timet is given by reh c f Z tf t cdt a t , 37 which is called the comoving event horizon. It is conceptually similar to the event horizon of black holes in that it de\ufb01nes a maximum distance out to which a signal can ever travel. Here, f denotes the \ufb01nal moment of conformal time .

Dotted lines show the worldlines of comoving objects. The particle horizon is the maximal distance from which we can receive signals. Thus the shaded region indicates regions of spacetime that are causally connected to us. The event horizon is the maximal distance to which we can send a signal.

Einstein s \ufb01eld equation plays a role in general relativity that is analogous to Poisson s equation in Newtonian dynamics. Poisson s equation, r2 4 G , 1 tells you how to compute the gravitational potential given the mass density . Analogously, Einstein s \ufb01eld equation is G\u00b5 8 G c4 T\u00b5 , 2 where G\u00b5 is the Einstein tensor,w h i c hi sa4 4s y m m e t r i ct e n s o rw h i c hd e p e n d so n derivatives of the metricg\u00b5 ,a n dT\u00b5 is thestress energy tensor, sometimes also called the energy momentum tensor, which quanti\ufb01es the density of energy and momentum and how they \ufb02ow. The tensors are symmetric, so the result is ten nonlinear second order di erential equations. Given the stress energy tensor, one can solve the \ufb01eld equation for the metricg\u00b5 determining how mass energy tells space how to curve. Armed with the metric one can then determine particle trajectories via thegeodesic equation, which depends on derivatives of the metric. Spacetime thus tells mass energy how to move, and the geodesic equation is the analog of taking the gradient of the gravitational potential to determine the Newtonian force on a particle. Solutions to the Einsten \ufb01eld equation can be extremely complicated. However, in the cosmological context the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy dramatically simplify the problem. Recall the RW metric ds2 c2dt2 a2 t dr2 Sk r d 2 , 3 where Sk r 8 R0 sin r R0 k 1 rk 0 R0 sinh r R0 k 1. 4 So for our present purposes, we need to understand how the energy denstiy and pressure P of the material in the universe determine the scale factora t , the curvature constantk, and R0 the radius of curvature at the present epoch. 1 The Friedmann Equation The equation of motion for the scale factora t k n o w na st h eF r i e d m a n ne q u a t i o nc a nb e derived in a quasi Newtonian fashion. The cosmological principle states that the the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic when aveaged over su ciently large scales. It thus follows that its global properties such as density and pressure at any time must be the same as those in 1 some volume su ciently small1 that Newtonian physics is valid but su ciently large that homogeneity and isotropy still hold . Consider such a small spherical region of \ufb01xed mass M enclosed within radiusR. Homogeneity and isotropy imply that the acceleration of a test particle at R should obey R GM R2 , 5 Note that, because of the homogeneity, there is no force due to pressure gradients and that only the mass within the sphere is relevant for the dynamics ofR.T h i s f o l l o w s d i r e c t l y from Birkho s theorem, according to which the gravitational acceleration at any radius in a spherically symmetric system depends only on the mass within that radius. We can multiply each side of this equation by R and integrate once to obtain 1 2 R2 GM R E. 6 Here E is a constant of integration which equals the energy per unit mass of a test particle at R. Now using the fact that the mass of the sphere is a constant equal toM 4 t R t 3 3, where t i st h em a s sd e n s i t y ,w ec a nr e w r i t et h ee q u a t i o na b o v ea s 1 2 R2 4 G R2 3 E, 7 If we now de\ufb01neR a t R0,w h e r eR0 is independent oft,i tt h e nf o l l o w s H2 t a a 2 8 G 3 kc2 R2 0a2 , 8 where wave have introduced a new integration constant,k 2E c2,t ob ei d e n t i \ufb01 e dw i t h the curvature constant in the RW metric in eqn. 4 . The equation above is known as theFriedmann equationand is one of the two fundamental equations describing the expansion of the universe. Although we derived it classically, its form is identical to the equation resulting from the proper treatment of GR. There are however two important di erences that only a full relativistic treatment can elucidate. First, the fully relativistic version of eqn. 5 for the acceleration from which we derived the Friedmann equation is R 4 G 3 R 3P c2 , 9 which encodes the fact that in GR pressure gravitates and the active energy density that sources gravity is now 3 P c2.T h i s e q u a t i o n f o r t h e a c c e l e r a t i o n a n d t h e F r i e d m a n n equation eqn. 8 in fact arise as independent equations from di erent components of the Einstein equation. The Friedmann equation turns out to be identical to our classical result provided that is taken as the energy density of anything, i.e. mass energy, radiation, 1By small here we mean relative to the Hubble radiuscH 1 0 and if the universe is curvedk 6 0 then also to the radius of curvatureR0 cH 1 0 . 2 i o truer very or vacuum energy note that following convention, we write as a mass density which is e ectively the energy density divided byc2 . But this dependence on pressure implies that one needs one more piece of information in order to solve for the universe s dynamics, namely the equation of state of each energy componentP w h i c hw ew i l lc o m et on e x t . The second di erence between the classical treatment and GR is that classically the energy E and radius R0 of this shell are arbitrary initial conditions att 0. Whereas in the full derivation from GR the curvature constantk is uniquely determined to bek 1 , 1, or 0 and R0 is the radius of curvature of the universe ifk 6 0 , both of which are determined by the mass energy contents of the universe. This profound connection between the geometry of the universe and its energy contents cannot be fully captured classically. To understand the physical implications of this relationship between geometry and mass energy it helps to de\ufb01ne the critical density c and the density parameter t c t 3H2 t 8 G and t c 10 such that the Friedmann equation eqn. 8 , can be written 1 t kc2 R2 0a2 t H2 t 11 which can be rearranged k t 1 R0a2 t cH 1 t 2 . 12 In this form, one more clearly sees how the curvature is related to the energy contents. There are three possibilities that can be distinguished provided one can measure the value of t at any time spatially open if at any time t 1t h e nt h i si m p l i e sk 0a n dt h eu n i v e r s eh a s negative curvature hyperbolic geometry . spatially closed if at any time t 1t h e nt h i si m p l i e sk 0a n dt h eu n i v e r s e has positive curvature spherical geometry . spatially \ufb02at if at any time t 1t h e nt h i si m p l i e sk 0a n dt h eu n i v e r s ei s\ufb02 a t and the geometry is Euclidean.

So for the rest of this course we will always assumek 0i m p l y i n gt h a tt h eg e o m e t r yi s Euclidean and allowing us to use the simplest form of the RW metric whereSk r r. 3 vnvu 2 The Fluid Equation We argued that the Friedmann equation encapsulates the idea of energy conservation that is the gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy of expansion must equal a constant. Let s consider another classical manifestation of energy conservation which is the \ufb01rst law of thermodynamics dQ TdS dU PdV, 13 where dQ is the heat \ufb02ow into or out of a volumeV , dU is the change in internal energy, P is the pressure anddV is the change in volume. Homogeneity requires that there is no bulk \ufb02ow of heatdQ 0 ,w h i c hi st os a yt h a tt h ee x p a n s i o no ft h eu n i v e r s ei sa d i a b a t i c . Dividing the equation above bydt implies U P V 0 . 14 Consider a sphere of comoving radiusrc expanding with the universal Hubble expansion, its proper radius will berp a t rc,a n dt h ep r o p e rv o l u m eo ft h i ss p h e r et ow h i c ht h e\ufb01 r s tl a w of thermodynamics should apply is V t 4 3 r3 c a3 t V 4 3 r3 c 3a2 a V 3 a a . 15 The internal energy of the sphere is U t V t c2 U c2 V V c2V 3 a a , 16 where is again the total mass energy density and we used eqn. 15 for V .C o m b i n i n g eqns. 14 16 gives the \ufb01nal result 3 a a P c2 0 , 17 which is known as the\ufb02uid equation or the continuity equation,a n di st h es e c o n dk e y equation, in addition to the Friedmann equation, for describing the expansion of the Universe. This important equation can also be thought of as describing energy conservation in the cosmological context. Notice that the classical notion of energy conservation is expressed by the continuity equation r ,w h i c hs t a t e st h a tt h er a t eo fc h a n g eo fe n e r g yd e n s i t y equals the negative divergence of the energy \ufb02ux . This can be derived via Noether s theorem because of symmetry under time translations. However, this symmetry is broken in an expanding spacetime, so the standard notion of energy conservation does not have to hold and is replaced by eqn. 17 . Let s now consider what happens when we combine these two key equations, i.e. the Fried mann equation in eqn. 8 and the \ufb02uid equation above. Let s start with the Friedmann 4 i equation multiplied through bya2 a2 8 G 3 a2 kc2 R2 0 . 18 Taking the time derivative yields 2 a a 8 G 3 a2 2 a a . 19 Dividing by 2 aa gives a a 4 G 3 a a 2 . 20 Combining with the \ufb02uid equation eqn. 17 we \ufb01nally obtain a a 4 G 3 3P c2 . 21 which is the fully relativistic version of theacceleration equation see eqn. 9 , which as mentioned previously, indicates that pressure as well as energy are sources of gravitational acceleration. 3 Equations of State and Energy Density Evolution To recap, we have discussed three equations that describe the expansion of the universe H2 t 8 G 3 kc2 R2 0a2 Friedmann equation 3 a a P c2 0 \ufb02 u i de q u a t i o n a a 4 G 3 3P c2 acceleration equation. 22 Only two of these are independent since we ve just seen that we can obtain the acceleration equation by combining the other two. These two independent equations however depend on three unknown functionsa t , t a n dP t , so we clearly need another equation to solve for the evolution of the universe. Speci\ufb01cally, what we need is an equation of state, which is a relationship between the pressureP and energy density , P , for whatever forms of energy \ufb01ll the universe. In principle there may be many di erent sources contributing to the energy density of the Universe matter both non relativistic and relativistic , radiation, dark energy, scalar \ufb01elds, etc. As we shall see later the Universe transited from a radiation dominated phase early on to a matter dominated phase at later stages. In addition, the Universe has become dominated by dark energy in the recent past. We therefore focus on these three energy components and 5 6 write the total energy density c2 m c2 z matter radiation z 4 SB c T4 de z dark energy , 23 where the m is the mass density, is the internal energy of the matter per unit mass i.e. 3 kBTm 2m f o ram o n a t o m i ci d e a lg a s ,w h e r ekB is Boltzmann s constant, andTm is the temperature of the matter ,T is the radiation \ufb01eld temperature, and de is the dark energy density. The pressure associated with any of these energy components is expressed according to an equation of state. Becuase cosmology only deals with dilute gases the equation of state always takes a simple linear form P w c2, 24 where w is a dimensionless number. Plugging this form into the \ufb02uid equation above see eqn. 22 3 a a w 0 , 25 which can be rearranged to give d 3 1 w da a . 26 Provided thatw is a constant we can integrate to obtain 0a 3 1 w , 27 were 0 is the energy density of some component of the energy density i.e. matter, radiation, dark energy at the present epoch i.e.a0 1 . L e t sc o n s i d e re a c hc o m p o n e n ti ns l i g h t l y more detail. 3.1 Matter To describe matter consider approximating the Universe as an ideal gas consisting ofN particles of massm such thatPmV NkBT, m mN V and hence Pm kBT m m. 28 Note that w 6 kBT m since m 6 .T o d e t e r m i n ew it is useful to write the equation of state of the ideal gas as a function of the adibatic index .R e c a l lt h a tf o ra ni d e a lg a s Pm 1 m 29 where is the internal energy per unit mass. For example for a monatomic ideal gas 5 3, 3 kBT 2m , and we recover the ideal gas law above for the pressure eqn. 28 . 6 We can make it explicit that in the non relativistic limit , the rest mass energy does not contribute to the gas pressure by noting that the total energy density c2 m c2 a n d rewriting the equation above as Pm 1 c2 mc2 3 0 Combining eqns 28 and 30 we can write Pm kBT mc2 1 1 1 kBT mc2 1 c2, 31 which implies w T kBT mc2 1 1 1 kBT mc2 1 . 32 Since for a non relativistic gaskBT mc2, we immediately see thatw T 1. in other words a non relativistic gas is well approximated by a \ufb02uid with zero pressurew 0w h i c h is often referred to as adust \ufb02uid. Since a 3 1 w ad u s t\ufb02 u i dh a s a 3 as expected. In other words, since the internal energy is negligible compared to the mass energy, it is only the dilution of the number of particles per proper volume that causes the mass energy density to decrease with the Universe s expansion. To understand how the Universe s expansion alters the temperature of this \ufb02uid we use kinetic theory which relates gas temperature to the random peculiar motions of the gas particles kBT mhv2i.W e l e a r n e d p r e v i o u s l y t h a t m o m e n t u m a n d velocity redshift away asv a 1,t h u sw eo b t a i nT a 2. 3.2 Radiation At early times the energy density of the universe is dominated by contributions from a hot plasma comprised of relativistic particles and radiation in thermal equilibrium at temperature T. To determine the equation of state and scalings with redshift during this period we approximate the energy density as arising from an ultra relativistic \ufb02uid of particles for which P c2 3 w 1 3. 33 This is just the familiar relationship between pressure and energy density for radiation, which an ultra relativistic \ufb02uid must clearly approximate. It can be derived explicitly by writing down the expressions forP and for Bose Einstein and Fermi Dirac statistics and carrying out the phase space integrals in the relativistic limit, which we will come to in a few lectures. We see then from eqn. 27 that for radiation a 4.F o rab l a c kb o d yr a d i a t i o n \ufb01eld T4 see eqn. 23 which then implies thatT a 1. Note the di erence between the temperature scaling for radiation and that that for a non relativistic ideal gasTm a 2 that we derived above. This important result explains how the cosmic microwave background CMB radiation maintains its blackbody form as the Universe expands. Prior to recombination the radiation 7 \u6d88\u6389Pm i is in thermal equilibrium with the matter due to the tight coupling provided by Thompson scattering o of electrons. This black body spectrum is frozen in after recombination when the opacity vanishes and photons are released. The number of photons is then simply conserved not true for a true black body , and the a 4 results from the intuitive explanation that the number of photons is a constant and the number density dilutes asa 3, but the extra factor ofa arises from the redshifting away of photon energy caused as the Universe expands, i.e.E h ,w i t h a 1.W e w i l l d e r i v e t h i s r e s u l t m o r e f o r m a l l y u s i n g statistical mechanics in a few lectures. 3.3 Dark Energy In classical physics there is no way for a vacuum to have energy. But quantum \ufb01eld theory permits particle antiparticle pairs to spontaneously appear and then annihilate from the vacuum. Just as there is an energy density associated with real particles in the Universe, there is an energy density vac associated with the virtual particle antiparticle pairs. One can then argue that the vacuum energy density vac is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that only depends on the energy di erence between the true and false vacua and knows nothing about the expansion of the Universe and thus vac must be independent of time. It then follows from the \ufb02uid equation eqn. 22 , that for vacuum energy since 0a 3 1 w const. P c2. 34 This concept of negative pressure can be di cult to wrap your mind around. One way to build physical intuition is to recall the \ufb01rst law of thermodynamics eqn. 14 dU PdV 0 . 35 If the vacuum is to have a positive energy density associated with it then expanding space creates more vacuum and hence more energy. This requires that work be done dU PdV 0 vacc2dV PvacdV Pvac vacc2. 36 This vacuum energy results inanti gravity that causes the expansion of the Universe to accelerate. From the acceleration equation ifPvac vacc2 a a 4 G 3 3P c2 8 G 3 vac. 37 More generally we can see that, assuming an equation of stateP w c2 a a 4 G 3 3P c2 4 G 3 1 3w . 38 Thus ifw 1 3 ! then a 0 and the expansion will accelerate. Any energy component that satis\ufb01es this criteria for its equation of state is referred to asdark energy. Table 3.3 indicates how each of the mass energy components we have discussed scales with 8 redshift. Table 1 Scalings with Scale Factor of Dominant Mass Energy Components.

Then the Friedmann equation att t0 becomes k,0 kc2 R2 0H2 0 1 0, 42 and we can recast the Friedmann equation at any timet or equivalently scale factora as H2 a H2 0 m,0a 3 r,0a 4 ,0 k,0a 2 , 43 or H z H0E z , 44 where E z m,0a 3 r,0a 4 ,0 k,0a 2 1 2 . 45 Finally, recalling the de\ufb01nition t t c t i ne q n . 1 0 ,w ec a na l s od e \ufb01 n et i m ed e pendent s for each component, i.e. m z m z c z , allowing us to also write the 9 Friedmann equation as m z r z z k z 1 . 46 10 from eqn1421 Phys 236 Cosmology Lecture 4 Model Universes and Distances Measures In this lecture we will numerically evaluate the densities at the present time in matter, radiation, and dark energy, and then discuss solutions to the Friedmann equation in various limiting cases. Once the expansion history is determined we can evaluate the distances and time between two points, and we will see that there are many ways to do so in an expanding Universe. 1 Densities at Present Previously we de\ufb01ned the density parameters of matter, radiation, and dark energy at the present time relative to the critical density c t0 3H2 0 8 G 9 .2 10 30 h 0.70 2 gc m 3 1 .4 1011 h 0.70 2 M Mpc 3, 1 such that m,0 m,0 c,0,e t c .

Well the numbers above suggest it is negligibly small, which it is at the present epoch. To be more precise, we will refer to this as the relativistic component to account for the fact that it can include more than just photons. The relativistic component is dominated by the CMB which is, to high accuracy, a black body at temperatureT 2 .73 K. A black body radiation \ufb01eld is described by the black body function, and it has an energy density c2 4 SBT4 c SB 2k4 B 60 3c2 , 6 1 where SB is the Stefan Boltzmann constant. We will explicitly derive the expression above later from statistical mechanics when we discuss thermal history. Plugging in numbers, we obtain ,0 4 .7 10 34 gc m 3 or ,0 5.1 10 5. 7 Note that the background radiation in starlight is about an order of magnitude lower than that contributed by the CMB so it can be safely neglected. Recall that the CMB is a relic from the time when the Universe was hot and dense enough to be opaque due to Thompson scattering to photons. If we extrapolate further back, we reach a time when the Universe was hot and dense enough to be opaque toneutrinos. What this means is that various interactions between neutrinos, leptons, and baryons kept the neutrinos tightly coupled to and in thermal equilibrium with the primordial radiation bath that dominates the energy density of the Universe. There is thus an equivalent background of relic cosmic neutrinos which we will treat as radiation , since the the neutrino mass is su ciently smallm c2 . 0.1e V t h a t w e c a n assume they are relativistic. The energy density of the cosmic neutrino background should be comparable to that of the photons. We will prove this explicitly later when we discuss thermal history, but intuitively this makes sense if you consider that relativistic gases in statsitical equilbrium ought to be in equipartition just like a non relativistic ideal gas. We will show that the cosmic neutrino background has a temperature comparable to but lower than the CMB T 4 11 1 3 T , 8 and that the corresponding energy density is 3 7 8 4 11 4 3 , 9 where the factor of 3 comes from the three left handed neutrino \ufb02avors, the factor of 7 8 comes from the fact that since neutrinos are fermions their statistical weights are slightly di erent than photons which are bosons, and the 4 11 4 3 comes from theT4 dependence of the energy density and eqn. 8 forT . Adding in the contribution from neutrinos, we thus \ufb01nd that r,0 7 .8 10 34 gc m 3 or r,0 8.6 10 5. 10 1.2 Matter Radiation Equality Now we have seen that at the present epoch r,0 m,0. However given that m a 3 and r a 4, there is some point in the past before which radiation dominated see Fig. 1 . We can determine when this occurred by calculating the time at which m,0a 3 r,0a 4 aeq 1 1 zeq r,0 m,0 r,0 m,0 11 2 20 3 0 which is known asmatter radiation equality.P l u g g i n gi nn u m b e r sw e\ufb01 n d 1 zeq 3 5 0 0 m,0 0.30 h 0.70 2 12 1.3 The Coincidence Problem We can similarly ask when did the dark energy ,0 0 .70 begin to dominate over matter m,0 0 .30, since matter density scales asa 3 in the Friedmann equation whereas the dark energy remains constant with time. This equality occurs at 1 zm 1 .33 ,0 m,0 0.70 0.30 1 3 13 or zm 0 .33, which is actually pretty recent see Fig. 1 . This raises the question of why dark energy is just starting to dominate the expansion rate now, or equivalently why ,0 m,0 O 1 , which has been referred to as thecoincidence problem1. The argument goes that one needs very special initial conditions in the early universe for this to be the case. Explanations for how this could more naturally arise abound. One example is postulating that the energy density of dark energy somehow tracks that in matter. Another is invoking ananthropic argument, i.e. in some ensemble of universes only those in which dark energy comes on the scene late would result in intelligent life that could observe the Universe. None of these explanations are particularly appealing but it is safe to say the coincidence problem is not keeping most cosmologists up at night. 2 Model Universes Consider the simplifying assumption that the Universe is dominated by a single energy com ponent. In this case the solutions to the Friedmann equation are analytic and is instructive to compute them. Assume a \ufb02at universe \ufb01lled with a single substanceX whose equation of state parameterw implies that it dilutes as X a 3 1 w , 14 as we argued previously from the \ufb02uid equation.

In other words, if rp is the proper distance between them which 5 would be measured with rulers at the timete they are being observed, then the comoving distance is this rp divided by the ratio of the scale factor of the Universe between then and now r rp a te 1 ze rp. 23 The total line of sight comoving distance r from us to a distant object is computed by integrating the in\ufb01nitesimal r contributions between nearby events along the radial ray from z 0 t t0 t ot h eo b j e c t . I no t h e rw o r d st od e t e r m i n et h el i n e o f s i g h tc o m o v i n g distance we integrate along the the null geodesic connecting us with the object, which given the equation for a null geodesicds2 cdt2 a2 t dr2 0 ,i m p l i e sdr cdt a t a n dh e n c e dc Z dr Z t0 te cdt a t , 24 from which we can see that this is a sum of in\ufb01tesimalcdt proper distances divided by the scale factora t at each epoch, making it a sum of in\ufb01tesimal comoving distances consistent with the discussion above.

Nevertheless, in some sense it is the fundamental distance measure in cosmology since, as we will see below, all the other distance measures can be simply expressed in terms of it. 3.2 Angular Diameter Distance Suppose that we can observe some yardstick whose proper length is known at a cosmological distance. Imagine this yardstick to be aligned perpendicular to our line of sight as illustrated 6 v z f Figure 2 An observer at the origin observes a yardstick of proper length at a comoving distance r. Figure from Ryden. in Fig. 2, such that it has constant, subtends an angle on the sky where 1, and that the light from this yardstick has a redshift ofz corresponding to some cosmic timete. The angular diameter distance is de\ufb01ned by dA , 30 in other words it is equal to the familiar proper distance to the yardstick in the small angle limit that would hold if the universe were static and Euclidean. To determine the relationship betweendA and the comoving distancedc we derived above, recall that the metric tells us us how to compute proper distances, and that the proper distance between two points is equal to the length of the spatial geodesic between them with time \ufb01xed at somete and thus with the scale factora te a l s o\ufb01 x e d ,i no t h e rw o r d sdt 0 ds2 a2 te dr2 S2 k r d 2 . 31 Thus the distance between two ends of the yardstick in Fig. 2 for which const and r const ds a te Sk r d . 32 Setting ds and d we deduce a te Sk r Sk r 1 z . 33 7 Using the de\ufb01nition ofdA above we then have dA Sk r 1 z . 34 We will typically focus on the casek 0f o rw h i c hSk r r,s u c ht h a tt h ec o m o v i n g distance to a distant object which emitted light atte corresponding to redshiftz is just the line of sight comoving distancedc that we calculated above, thus we \ufb01nd dA dc z 1 z. 35 Fig. 3 shows the angular diameter distancedA for the benchmark model and for two other spatially \ufb02at k 0 u n i v e r s e s ,o n ed o m i n a t e db ym a t t e ra n do n ed o m i n a t e db yac o s m o logical constant.

Figure from Ryden. 8 \u02c7 Figure 4 An observer at the origin observes a source of luminosityL at comoving coordinate location r, , a tt i m ete corresponding to redshiftz. Figure from Ryden. 3.3 Luminosity Distance Another important distance measure is the luminosity distancedL.I m a g i n et h a tw eh a v ea source whose luminosityL is known as depicted in Fig. 4. HereL is the bolometric luminosity which is the speci\ufb01c luminosityL integrated over all wavelengths .I fw em e a s u r et h e\ufb02 u x of this objectf similarly integrated over all wavelengths on Earth, we de\ufb01ne the luminosity distance by dL L 4 f 1 2 . 36 Analogous to the angular diameter distance, this is what the proper distance to the source would be if the universe were static and Euclidean, since the dilutuion of light would follow the inverse square lawf L 4 d2 . Let us derive what the luminosity distancedL should be by calculating what the \ufb02ux should be on Earth, which we can always do by working with physical quantities i.e. proper time, proper distance, observed energy . There are three e ects we need to consider in an expanding universe 1. At the time timet0 that the light reaches earth, we want to calculate the proper area of a sphere drawn around the source and passing through Earth. Again, since we want ap r o p e ra r e a ,t h i sc a nb ed e t e r m i n e df r o mt h em e t r i c ,i no t h e rw o r d sf o rs o m es o l i d angle d a tt h es o u r c es u b t e n d e db yad i e r e n t i a la r e adA on Earth we have dA a2 t0 S2 k r d . 37 Noting that the scale factor is evaluated atz 0 t t0 w h i c hi sa t0 1 and 9 \u02c7 integrating over solid angle we obtain A 4 S2 k r . 38 2. Redshifting of the photons due to the expansion of the universe causes the energy of each photon from the source to decrease. If the a photon starts with energyEe h e when the scale factor isa te , it arrives at Earth with energyE0 h 0 h ea te h e 1 z r e d u c e db yaf a c t o ro f 1 z . 3. Time dilation implies that the time between the photon detections on Earth att0 is longer than the time between photon emissions att te.

By the time we detect these photons on Earth the proper distance between them will bec tea t0 a te c t0,s ow es e et h a t t0 1 z te. Putting this all together we arrive at the correct formula for the observed \ufb02ux on Earth from our source of luminosityL at redshiftz f L 4 S2 k R 1 z 2 , 39 which combined with the de\ufb01nition of luminosity distance in eqn. 36 gives dL Sk r 1 z , 40 from which we immediately see that dL 1 z 2dA. 41 For the case where space is \ufb02at recall that dA dc 1 z 4 2 and so dL 1 z dc. 43 Fig. 5 shows the luminosity distancedL as a function of redshift for the Benchmark Model and for two other \ufb02at universes, one dominated by matter and one dominated by a cosmological constant. 3.4 Lookback Time The lookback timetL to an object is the di erence betweeen the aget0 of the universe now at observation and the agete of the universe at the time photons were emitted by some object. It is used to compare the properties of distant high redshift objects with evolutionary models and to quote an overall age of the universe.

It is the proper volume times three factors of the relative scale factor now to then, 1 z 3.

The comoving volume element and its integral are both used frequently in predicting number counts or luminosity densities of extragalactic objects. 12 Phys 236 Cosmology Lecture 5 7 Thermal History An important feature of the standard cosmology is that the temperature of the Universe was arbitrarily high at the earliest times shortly after the Big Bang. Recall that we derived the scalings T 1010 K kBT 1M e V 107 gc m 3 1 4 1 z 1010 t 1s 1 2 , 1 and thus the temperature is decreasing continuously as a function of time. We derived this scaling via a simple application of thermodynamics to a small patch of the homogeneous and isotropic Universe. In the next few lectures we will show that this thermal history combined with statistical mechanics, particle, nuclear, and atomic physics, allows a detailed prediction of the matter content of the universe at each epoch. 1 General Overview Previously we used the \ufb01rst law of thermodyanmics dQ TdS dE PdV, 2 and made the assumption that the expansion is adiabaticdQ TdS 0t od e r i v et h e\ufb02 u i d equation 3 a a p 0 . 3 In deriving the \ufb02uid equation we have made a very strong assumption the universe is comprised of perfect \ufb02uids which evolve according to a sequence of adiabatic reversible transformations dS 0, i.e. at each instant the universe is in an equilibrium state. Although the treatment of the contents of the universe as perfect \ufb02uids allowed us to derive the basic equations governing the expansion of the universe, it is not su cient for detailed study of the behavior and interactions of realistic particles at high temperature. For this we need to use statistical mechanics to describe the distribution functions of the Universe s constituent particles, and we need to think very carefully about what it means to be in thermal equilibrium. It could be that some particles are in equlibrium with each other, whereas others are not. For example previously we discussed that the Universe is currently permeated with a cosmic background of relativistic neutrinos as well as the cosmic microwave background. Whereas the CMB is a black body radiation \ufb01eld atT0 2 .73 K, the cosmic neutrino background has an equilibrium distribution with a di erent lower temperatureT ,0 1 .95 K. The di erence in these temperatures results from the neutrinos dropping out of equilibrium with the photons around one second after the Big Bang. We will discuss this in more detail later, and actually derive this temperature di erence. As we will see the most general non equilibrium description of the coupled distributions of particle species comes from solving the Boltzman equation. In this context, thermal 1 equilibrium dS 0a r i s e sa s s u m i n ge i t h e rn oi n t e r a c t i o n sa m o n gp a r t i c l e s e . g . a d i a b a t i c expansion , or by assuming a very high rate of interactions such that thermal equilbrium between di erent species can be achieved. The latter scenario is the key to undersatnding the thermal history of the universe. Speci\ufb01cally we will compare therate of interactions t ot h erate of expansionH. When H,t h e nt h et i m es c a l eo fp a r t i c l ei n t e r a c t i o n s is much smaller than the characteristic expansion time scale tc 1 tH 1 H , 4 then thermal equilibrium will be reached before the e ect of the expansion cooling becomes relevant. Particles interact so frequently that they do not care about the cosmological expansion any change in their energy density is rapidly shared among other particles via these rapid interactions maintaining thermal equilibrium. For a given particle species the interaction rate is de\ufb01ned by n vrel vrel mfp , 5 where n is the number density of projectile particles,vrel is the relative velocity between projectiles and targets, and is the interaction cross section, and the last equality used the de\ufb01nition of the mean free path mfp 1 n . Thus the condition H can be thought of equivalently as saying that the particle mean free path mfp vtH 6 is much shorter than the distance it can travel in the Hubble timetH,o ri ft h ep a r t i c l ei s relativistic that the mean free path is much shorter than the Hubble distancedH c H. Note that is di erent for di erent fundamental interactions and for di erent particle species and masses. Therefore, the above condition in eqn. 4 is valid for all the known and perhaps unknown particles in the very early universe but, as the universe expands, it is eventually broken at di erent times for di erent species. This is the essence of thethermal history of the universe. At the very beginning we are talking about tiny fractions of seconds after the Big Bang all the particles were in thermal equilibrium in a primordial soup known as theprimordial plasma,w h i c hi so f t e na l s or e f e r r e dt oa st h eprimordial radiation bath. When for a species, the condition H is reached, it decouples from the primordial plasma. If it does this by breaking the chemical equilibrium of some reaction for example pair production e e , then this reaction is said tofreeze out and the products attain some \ufb01xed relic abundance.1 The fundamental interactions which characterize the aforementioned processes compel some particles to react and transform into others and vice versa. When H these reactions take place with equal probability in both directions, hence the symbol, but when H eventually one direction is preferred over the other. This is the characteristic of irreversibility 1It attains a \ufb01xed abundance if it is a stable particle, of course. If not it disappears. 2 o wet which causes equilibrium thermodynamics to fail, and thus demands the use of the Boltzmann equation. For example, we shall use the Boltzmann equation to calculate the relic abundance of CDM, quantify the recombination of protons and electrons into neutral hydrogen atoms, and analyze the formation of light elements duringBig Bang Nucleosynthesis. 2 Brief Summary of Thermal History In what follows we give a brief overview of some of the most important events that took place in the early thermal history of the Universe. Planck scale, in\ufb02ation, and Grand Uni\ufb01ed TheoryIn principle, ast !1 a t ! 0, but there comes a point at which this extrapolation of General Relativity, which is not a quantum theory of gravity, must break down. This is when the thermal energy of typical particles is such that their de Brogile wavelength is smaller than their Schwarzschild radius quantum black holes clearly cause di culties with the usual concept of background space time. Equating 2 mc w i t h2Gm c2 yields a characteristic mass for quantum gravity known as thePlanck mass. This mass, and the corresponding length Pl mPlc , and time Pl c form the sytem ofPlanck units mPl r c G 1019 GeV 7 Pl r G c3 10 35 m 8 tPl r G c5 10 43 s 9 The Planck time thus sets the origin of time for the classical phase of the Big Bang. Another commonly used Planck mass unit is MPl r c 8 G 2 .4 1018 GeV, 10 where a factor of 8 is introduced in the square root. The reason for this is that at early times when the curvature term a 2 in the Friedmann equation is negligibly small compared to the steepera dependence of the components of , one can then write the Friedmann equation as H2 3M2 Pl , 11 in particle physics units where 1 . In\ufb02ation is another very important piece of the current description of the primordial universe. We shall dedicate a lecture to it later on. For now, it is su cient to say that it occurs at an energy scale of the order 1016 GeV, which is the same scale as the Grand Uni\ufb01ed Theory GUT , i.e. models in which electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions are uni\ufb01ed. Baryogenesis and LeptogenesisRelativistic quantum \ufb01eld theory requires the existence of anti particles, which poses a slight puzzle. Particles and anti particles annihilate through 3 processes such as e e . 12 If initally the universe was \ufb01lled with equal amounts of matter and anti matter then we expect these annihilations to lead to a universe dominated by radiation. Basically, once the universe cools down below the mass energy of some baryon or lepton,kBT . mc2,p a i r production from the primordial plasma will eventually become energetically unfavorable and the reaction will no longer proceed to the left to produce particles and anti particles. Instead all the matter and anti matter will annihilate away leaving a universe \ufb01lled with radiation. However, we do observe an overabundance of matter mostly baryons over anti matter in the universe today. In order for this to be the case there needs to be some primordial matter antimatter asymmetry in the inital conditions. In other words, baryogenesis is the creation, via some as of yet unclear mechanism, of an overall positive baryon number. In order to maintain the neutrality of the universe, we thus also need Leptogenesis, i.e. a mechanism which produces a non vanishing lepton number in the form of an excess of electrons over positrons. Although many ideas for baryogenesis exist, none is singled out by experimental tests. We will not have much to say about baryogenesis in this course. Electroweak phase transitionAt a thermal energy of about 100 GeV, which corresponds to 10 12 seconds after the Big Bang, the electromagnetic and weak forces start to behave distinctly. This leads to a drastic change in the strength of the weak interaction which results in a phase transition. QCD phase transitionBelow 150 MeV quarks pass from their asymptotic freedom and bound states form from two mesons or three baryons of them. The above energy corre sponds roughly to 20\u00b5sa f t e rt h eB i gB a n g . Dark matter freeze outSince dark matter is very weakly interacting with ordinary matter we expect it to decouple relatively early on. We will study the example of WIMPs weakly interacting massive particles that freeze out around 10 100 GeV. We will show that choosing natural values for the mass of the dark matter particles and their interaction cross section with ordinary matter reproduces the observed relic dark matter density surprisingly well. Neutrino decouplingAt T 1010 K corresponding to an energy around 1 MeV, or around 1 s after the Big Bang a host of interactions between neutrinos anti neutrinos, leptons elec trons positrons and baryons protons and neutrons become ine ecient and neutrinos drop out of thermal equilibrium with the primordial plasma. After this neutrinos decouple and simply redshift away their energy until the present epoch, but their contribution to the total radiation energy density of the universe is not negligible. It thus alters when matter radiation equality takes place, and as a result the strength of anisotropies in the CMB. Electron positron annihilationThe interaction e e , 13 will remain in thermal equilibrium provided the energykBT of the primordial plasma is larger than the mass of electrons and positronsmec2 511 keV. When the temperature of the thermal bath drops below this value pair production is no longer possible and annihilation 4 takes over. The entropy and energy from these electron positron pairs is then transferred to the photon bath, but since the neutrinos already decoupled earlier, this explains the small temperature di erence between the nutrinos and the CMB today, which we will derive explicitly. Thanks to leptogenesis, positrons disappear and only electrons are left. Big Bang Nucleosynthesis BBN At t af e wm i n u t e s T 109 K , nucleosynthesis starts, synthesizing protons and neutrons to produce D, He and a few other elements. Since the temperature is still too high for the formation of neutral atoms, all these elements are highly ionized. Recombination At T 4000 K t 2 105 yr roughly 50 of the baryonic matter is in the form of neutral atoms. This point in time is often called the time ofrecombination. Because of the resulting drop in the number density of free electrons, the universe suddenly becomes transparent to photons which is known asdecoupling.T h e s e p h o t o n s a r e o b s e r v e d today as the cosmic microwave background. From this point on, photons, neutrinos, H, He and other atoms all expand freely with the Universe. Just before this time, the energy density in relativistic particles became smaller than that in the rest mass of non relativistic matter, and the Universe enters the matter dominated epoch. 3 Equilibrium Thermodynamics 3.1 A Note on Units We will always keep units throughout all of our calculations. But as the study of the thermal history of the universe is concerned with high energy physics, you will often see results in other references in the natural unit system in which the speed of lightc,B o l t z m a n n s constant kB,a n dP l a n c k sc o n s t a n t hP 2 are all set to 1. In cgs units c c m s 1, g c m2 s 1,a n d kB g c m2 s 2 K 1.T h e r e f o r e , m a k i n g t h e s e c o n s t a n t s d i m e n s i o n l e s s implies that energy mass temperature time 1 l e n g t h 1, 14 and all physical quantities can be expressed in one unit, which is usually energy. Another way to state this is that in SI units the fundamental units are mass, length, and time whereas in natural units the fundamental units are velocity, action energy time , and energy. Since we have set the velocity unitc 1a n dt h ea c t i o nu n i t 1 ,t h eo n l y remaining thing with dimensions is energy. The unit of choice for energy is the electron volt , where the energy scales are eV in atomic physics, MeV in nuclear physics, and GeV in particle physics. Whenever needed, the missing powers ofc, kB,a n d in equations can be reinserted straightforwardly from simple dimensional analysis. Appendix C.1 of Baumann s book has a nice explanation of natural units and how to convert into SI units. One useful thing to note is that number densities in these natural units will typically be expressed as n T3 or n mT 3 2, 15 5 which in normal units become n kBT c 3 or n mc2kBT 2c2 3 2 mkBT 2 3 2 . 16 From these the units of energy density or pressure then just have an extra factor of energy multiplied in, and it should be obvious which constant is needed to get the correct units. 3.2 Distribution Functions Figure 1 Phase space of position and momentum in one dimension. Volume of each cell is 2 , the smallest region into which a particle can be con\ufb01ned because of Heisenberg s uncertainty principle. Shaded region has in\ufb01nitesmal volumedxdp which covers nine cells. To count the appropriate number of cells, therefore, the phase space integral must be R dxdp 2 As we discussed, through most of the early universe, reactions proceeded rapidly enough to keep particles in equilibrium, such that di erent species share a common temperature. We will often want to express the number density, energy density, pressure, etc. in terms of this temperature. For this reason, and many others which will emerge shortly, it is convenient to introduce the occupation number, ordistribution function f of a species. This distribution function counts the number of particles in a given region in phase space2 2Note that here we are working in proper coordinates, i.e.x is a proper position coordinate, and byp 6 around a positionx and momentump. Then if we want to determine the energy of a species we would construct the weighted sum of the energy of each state over all of the phase space elements Pf x, p E p . How many phase space elements are there in a region of volume dx3dp3? By Heisenberg s uncertainty principle, no particle can be localized into a region of phase space smaller than 2 3, so this is the size of a fundamental element. Therefore, the number of phase space elements indx3dp3 is dx3dp3 2 3 see Fig. 1 . Homogeneity implies that this distribution function should be independent of positionx,a n di s o t r o p yr e q u i r e st h a tf f p d e p e n d s only on the magnitude of the momentump p .W e c a n t h u s i n t e g r a t e o u t t h e s p a t i a l p a r t over the volume to obtain that the density in phase space is the density of states times the distribution function g 2 3 f p , 17 where g is a degeneracy factor which counts internal degrees of freedom e.g. spin . The number densityof particles in real space is found by integrating eqn. 17 over momentum n g 2 3 Z d3pf p . 18 To obtain the energy density of the gas particles we have to weight each momentum by its energy. To a very good approximation the particles in the early universe were weakly interacting. This allows us to ignore the interaction energies between the particles and simply write that the energy of a particle of massm and momentump simply as E p p m2c4 p2c2. 19 This then implies that the energy density is g 2 3 Z d3pf p E p . 20 and the pressure is P g 2 3 Z d3pf p p2c2 3E p , 21 where the last equation for the pressureP comes from a generalization of the standard kinetic theory derivation of the pressure of an ideal gas to the case of a relativistic gas see Mukhanov Physical Foundations of Cosmology 3.3.2 for a derviation . It is immediately clear that if the particles are relativisticE2 p2c2 see eqn. 19 that eqn. 21 then implies P 3o rw 1 3a sw ea r g u e dp r e v i o u s l yi st h ec a s ef o rr a d i a t i o n . here we mean the not the comoving momentum but rather the proper momentum which redshifts away with the expansion. 7 3.3 Equilibrium Distribution Functions To properly describe the physical processes in an expanding universe including departures from equilibrium, we need, strictly speaking, a full kinetic theory which we will come to later. Fortunately, there are many situations in the early universe when the particles are in a state of local thermodynamic equilibrium LTE with each other. We qualify this equilibrium with the word local to stress that the Universe cannot be treated as a typical thermodynamic system in equilibrium with an in\ufb01nite thermal bath at some given temperature it is a dynamically evolving nonequilibrium system. More concretely, we know that the temperature of the thermal bath changes as the universe expands. Therefore, by local equilibrium we simply mean that matter has maximal possible entropy. In practice entropy will be maximized for a species when H as we discussed already. We will come to an even clearer de\ufb01nition of what is meant by LTE shortly. It can be shown that for a system of particles constrained to have a \ufb01xed amount of total energy E and number of particlesN the entropy is maximized, and thus the system is in LTE, when its particles have the following distribution function f p 1 e E p \u00b5 kBT 1, 22 where the sign is for fermions electrons, or baryons, i.e. protons and neutrons which obey Fermi Dirac statistics and the for bosons photons which obey Bose Einstein statistics.

Speci\ufb01cally, it is de\ufb01ned as the derivative of the entropy with respect to the number of particlesN,a t\ufb01 x e de n e r g ya n d\ufb01 x e dv o l u m e ,m u l t i p l i e db yt h et e m p e r a t u r e \u00b5 T S N E,V . 24 Taking into account the possibility of changing particle number, the \ufb01rst law of thermody namics becomes dQ TdS dE PdV \u00b5dN, 25 where \u00b5dN is sometimes called thechemical work. 8 Now let us consider some reaction that is capable of changing members of one species into members of another species. We will denote this reaction in the following form 1A1 2A2 lAl X j jAj 0 . 26 The coe cients l are known as the stoichiometric factors, and they simply specify how the numbers of the di erent species are related. For example, consider the reaction 2H2 O 2 2H2O. 27 In this caseA1 H 2, A2 O 2, A3 H 2O, 1 2 , 2 1 ,a n d 3 2. The meaning of this is that every forward reaction destroys 2 H2 molecules and 1 O2 molecule, and produces 2H 2Om o l e c u l e s . In LTE we know thatdS 0w h i c ht h e ni m p l i e s dS X i S Ni dNi X i \u00b5i Ti dNi X i \u00b5i T dNi 0 ! X i \u00b5idNi 0 , 28 where the last equality used the fact that the temperatures must all be the same in equi librium Ti T.I f t h i s c o n d i t i o nP i \u00b5idNi 0w e r en o ts a t i s \ufb01 e dt h e nt h ep a r t i c l e sc o u l d convert into each other to increase the entropy further violating our assumption dS 0 o f LTE. But given the de\ufb01nition of chemical potential, a single forward reaction results in the follow ing change in the entropy X i i \u00b5i Ti , 29 and the negative of this for a backward reaction. Thus we can identify dNi i.I n equilibrium whereT Ti the condition thatdS 0t h u si m p l i e si nt e r m so ft h es t o c h i o m e t r i c factors X i i\u00b5i 0 , 30 The equation above de\ufb01nes what we will refer to aschemical equilibrium. If the number of particles is not constrained then the chemical potential is zero. For example for black body radiation which is an equilibrium con\ufb01gruation, the number of photons in the system is not conserved. A photon may collide with an electron in the wall of the cavity, exciting it to a higher energy state, removing a photon from the photon gas. This electron may drop back to its lower level in a series of steps, each one of which releases an individual photon back into the photon gas. Although the sum of the photon energies of the emitted photons are the same as the absorbed photon, the number of emitted photons will vary. Another simple example of photon non conservation is double Compton scattering e e which happens in equilibrium at high temperatures. The only way that 9 these changes in photon number can maintaindS 0i si f S N 0 ,i m p l y i n g \u00b5 0 . 31 This implies that if the chemical potential of a particleX is \u00b5X,t h e nt h ec h e m i c a lp o t e n t i a l of the corresponding anti particle X is \u00b5 X \u00b5X. 32 To see this, just consider particle antiparticle annihilation,X X . For the purposes of computing the equilibrium distribution functions we will be able to ignore the chemical potentials because it can be shown that they are negligibly small compared to kBT.Y o u w i l l s h o w t h a t t h i s i s t h e c a s e i n t h e h o m e w o r k .B u t f o r s i t u a t i o n s w h e r e w e a r e trying to study chemical equilibrium, we will of course not be able to neglect them. Finally, we can now make the distinction betweenkinetic equilibrium and chemical equilibrium.C o n s i d e rar e a c t i o nf o rw h i c h H of the type A B C D, 33 or in terms of chemical potentials, \u00b5A \u00b5B \u00b5C \u00b5D, 34 which we de\ufb01ne aschemical equilibrium. On the other hand, when H refers to a reaction such as scattering A B A B, 35 this is referred to askinetic equilibrium. Mathematically kinetic equilibrium implies that the distribution functions for both species A and B are of the form given in eqn. 22 at the same temperature T. In general, it is possible for a species to break chemical equilibrium and still remain in kinetic equilibrium with the rest of the cosmic plasma through scattering processes. We will thus use LTE to refer to a situation where the particles under consideration are in kinetic or chemical equilibrium or both . In practical terms LTE will mean the particles under consideration share a common equilibrium temperature Ti T, and often this temperature T will be identi\ufb01ed with the photon temperatureT which we will refer to as the temperature of the universe . 3.5 Expressions for n, , andP Given the distribution function, we can then calculate the number densityn,e n e r g yd e n s i t y and pressure P. In what follows we will work out two important special cases, namely relativistic and non relativistic particles. 10 3.5.1 Relativistic Species mc2 kBT, \u00b5 kBT In the relativistic limit, we can write the energy asE pc.G o i n g t h r o u g h t h e m a t h o n e \ufb01nds for the number density n g kBT 3 3 2 3c3 1b o s o n s 3 4 fermions , 36 energy density g kBT 4 2 30 3c3 1b o s o n s 7 8 fermions , 37 and pressure P 3 . 38 There are several points here that are worth noting. First, we have now derived from statistical mechanics the equation of state for radiation, and indeed we \ufb01nd thatw P 1 3. Second, plugging in numbers for photons which are bosons withg 2w ea r i v ea t the Stefan Boltzmann relation aRT4 4 SBT4 c SB k4 B 2 60 3c2 5 .6704 10 8Js 1m 2K 4. 39 where the Stefan Boltzmann constant is de\ufb01ned above. 3.5.2 Non Relativistic Species mc2 kBT, \u00b5 kBT In the limitmc2 kBT and \u00b5 kBT we can use the fact thatv2 c2 kBT mc2 1 i.e. v2 kBT m is the rms velocity of an ideal gas , and hencep2 m2c2 v2 c2 1. Then we can expand the energy to \ufb01rst order inp2 m2c 2 to obtain E p m2c4 p2c2 mc2 p2 2m. 40 In the non relativistic limit, the equilibrium distribution functionf p a l s oa s s u m e st h e Maxwell Boltzmann form see eqn. 23 , sincemc2 kBT implies kBT E \u00b5.C o m b i n i n g these two approximations, eqn. 18 for the particle number density integrates to n g mkBT 2 2 3 2 e mc2 kBT . 41 So we \ufb01nd that in the non relativistic limit massive particles are exponentially rare at tem peratures much smaller than their rest mass energykBT mc2.I n a d d i t i o n , p l u g g i n g eqn. 40 into eqn. 20 gives n mc2 3 2kBT nmc2. 42 11 Analogously for the pressure P,w o r k i n gt o\ufb01 r s to r d e ri np2 m2c2 i ne q n . 2 1 m e a n s expanding E p p m2c4 p2c2 mc2 to zeroth order, it then immediately follows that P nkBT P 0 , 43 or w P 0 for matter. Which is the full derivation of what we concluded before, that non relativistic matter behaves like a dust \ufb02uid. 3.6 Interpretation By comparing the relativistic limit kBT mc2 a n dt h en o n r e l a t i v i s t i cl i m i t kBT mc2 , we see that the number density, energy density, and pressure of a particle species fall exponentially are Boltzmann suppressed as the temperature drops below the mass of the particle. This re\ufb02ects the coupling to the photon \ufb02uid in the primordial plasma at the equilibrium temperature. When kBT mc2 the photons have su cient energy to create a thermal background number density of particle antiparticle pairs. However, when kBT mc2 only an exponential tail of the photon distribution function has su cient energy for pair creation, causing a similar suppression of their number density. This exponential suppression has several important consequences. First it implies that non relativistic particles either become exponentially rare, or that their numbers drop below the density where they interact su ciently often to stay in equilibrium recall tht n v a n d hence they go out of equilibrium ordecouple and the interactions are said tofreeze out. Both cases are of interest. For example, electrons and positrons interact very strongly via the Coulomb force and so maintain equilibrium until there are almost no positrons left atkBT mec2 0.5M e V t h e y all annihilate with electrons . Other particles that interact weakly, likeweakly interacting massive particlesor WIMPs,w h i c ha r ead a r km a t t e rc a n d i d a t e ,w o u l ds i m p l yr a p i d l y drop out of equilibrium and hencefreeze out,p o s s i b l yg i v i n gr i s et oas i g n i \ufb01 c a n tr e l i c abundance of matter indeed this is why they are a dark matter candidate, as we will discuss . Finally, we observe that particles following these equilibrium distributionscan only contribute signi\ufb01cantly to the energy density and pressure when they are relativistic.Thus if we have a collection of relativistic species, each of them having an equilbirium at di erent temperatures Ti,w ec a nw r i t et h et o t a le n e r g yd e n s i t y , R,a sas u mo v e ra l lt h ec o n t r i b u t i o n s R X i i 2 30 3c3 g? T kBT 4, 44 where we have introducedg?,t h ee ective number of degrees of freedom,g i v e nb y g? T X bosons gi Ti T 4 7 8 X fermions gi Ti T 4 , 45 where T is equilibrium temperature of the photon bath. Note that this only requires the dif 12 ferent components to haveequilibrium distributions which are what determine the densities and pressures at temperaturesTi t h e c o m p o n e n t s d o n t a c t u a l l y n e e d t o m a i n t a i n s t r o n g self interactions such that they are in equilibrium with each other in which case one would have Ti T . As long as an equilibrium distribution is maintained after they go out of thermal equilibrium as we will discuss next , and that they are relativistic, they contribute signi\ufb01cantly to the energy density in the early radiation dominated phase of the universe. As the temperature decreases, the e ective number of degrees of freedom in radiation will decrease, as massive particles start behaving non relativistically whenkBT drops below their rest mass energy. In Fig. 2 we show a numerical calculation of the full evolution ofg?,w h i c h is based on the properties of particles in the standard model, which are listed in Table 3. We brie\ufb02y discuss a few regimes of interest kBT 1M e V t h eo n l yr e l a t i v i s t i cp a r t i c l e sw o u l db et h e3n e u t r i n os p e c i e sa n dt h e corresponding anti neutrinos3 fermions, 1 degree of freedom each and the photons boson, 2 polarization states . Neutrinos at these energies are decoupled from the thermal bath see 4 , but maintain a thermal distribution at a slightly lower temper ature than the photons, withT 4 11 1 3T we will derive this in detail shortly . Therefore g? 2 z photons neutrinos anti neutrinos z 7 8 3 3 4 11 4 3 3.36 . 46 1M e V T 100 MeV Electrons and positrons have a mass of about 0.5M e V , and so they are now also relativistic. As the di erence between neutrino and photon temperature is due to electron positron annihilation which occurs at later times see discussion in 4 , we haveT T and so g? 2 z photons neutrinos antineutrinos z 7 8 3 3 7 8 2 2 z electrons positrons 1 0.75 47 T 300 GeV this is above the electroweak uni\ufb01cation scale, and for the particles in the Standard Model we haveg 106.75.4 3Whether or not anti neutrinos exist depends on whether neutrinos have aMajorana mass or a Dirac mass. Anti neutrinos exist in the latter scenario, whereas in the former scenario neutrinos are their own anti particle like photons. See the Aside on neutrinos in 3.1.2 of Baumann s book for more details. Since the total number of degrees of freedom needs to be the same in both of these scenarios to satisfy Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, we will just refer to the anti neutrino i.e. Dirac mass case for concreteness. 4If there are additional new particles,g? could increase further. 13 Figure 2 The full evolution of the e ective degrees of freedomg? with temperature for the standard model. The masses on the top axes indicate a few speci\ufb01c masses of particles in the standard model at temperatures higher than the mass they are approximately in equilibrium, below the mass they annihilate. The QCD phase transition is more complicated, and the evolution cannot be evaluated analytically in that regime at higher temperatures the evolution also has non trivial corrections and may not asymptote to the full thermal result of 106.75 . The value today,g? 3 .38, is the analytic result 3.36 plus a small correction because neutrino decoupling ande e annihilation overlap slightly, slightly heating the neutrinos to a higher temperature than 4 11 T . The valueg? 86.25 is what s you d expect for everything exceptW ,W ,Z 0, Higgs which all have m mW and the top quark being in equilibrium, which does not accurately match the plateau because of non trivial QCD and electroweak e ects. Figure from Antony Lewis notes. 3.7 Distribution of Decoupled Species An Example the CMB We can now apply what we have learned so far to the CMB. First consider the following question why is the CMB observed to be a perfect black body radiation \ufb01eld today? Recall that a black body radiation \ufb01eld is what results when radiation and matter are in thermal equilibrium with each other. At present, the radiation and matter in the universe are wildly out of equilbrium with each other. Indeed, most of the baryons are in the form of ionized gas in the IGM at temperatureT 104 but the CMB is atT 2 .73 K. So what gives, why should the CMB be a perfect black body today? The answer of course is that the radiation and matter were in thermal equilibrium in the past due to Thompson scattering of photons with electrons and at this time the radiation \ufb01eld was a black body. This equilibrium was maintained until some timetf , which we will refer to as the time of ofphoton decouplingwhich is closely related to but not exactly the same as last scattering.T h e p h o t o n s d e c o u p l e f r o m t h e m a t t e r b e c a u s e d u r i n grecombination the formation of the \ufb01rst atoms rapidly decreases the electron density causing the opacity to suddenly drop. After this timetf ,t h ec o n d i t i o n H is violated where is the Thompson scattering rate , the universe becomes transparent to Thompson scattering, and the photons decouple from the matter. The CMB is thus a relic radiation \ufb01eld, and the black body that is frozen in is a vestige of the timest t f when it was in thermal equilibrium. Let s now 14 photonaaoy Figure 3 The standard model particles, with their mass, spin and degeneraciesgs. Table from Baumann. understand how this works mathematically using what we have learned. Recalling our expression for the number density in terms of the distribution function in eqn. 18 , at some timet t f when the radiation is in thermal equilibrium the number 15 density of photons is n g 2 3 Z f p d3p g 2 2 3 Z 1 0 p2dp eE T 1 Z 1 0 8 c3 2d eh kBT 1, 48 where in the last equality we usedE pc h , p h c 2 c,a n dg 2f o rp h o t o n s . We can rewrite this as n Z nT d nT 8 c3 2 eh kBT 1, 49 where nT i st h ep h o t o nf r e q u e n c yd i s t r i b u t i o nf u n c t i o n ,i . e . t h en u m b e ro fp h o t o n s between and d at times t t f and temperature T when LTE holds hence the subscript T . What happens at later timest t f ?T h e p h o t o n s n o w t r a v e l f r e e l y t h r o u g h t h e u n i v e r s e without scattering o of electrons. We can write that their distribution functionn , t o b e y s n , t d a tf a t 3 n 0,t f d 0, 50 which simply expresses conservation of the number of photons after decoupling. Hence the factors a tf a t 3,w h i c ha r i s ef r o mt h ed i l u t i o no fp h o t o n sd u et oc o s m i ce x p a n s i o n . W e can relate 0 at t tf to at time t by noting that aftertf photons simply redshift away their energy, such that 0a tf a t ! 0 a t a tf . So we \ufb01nd n , t d a tf a t 3 n a t a tf ,t f d a t a tf . 51 We thus see that the ratio of scale factorsa t a tf a l lc a n c e le x c e p ti nt h ee x p o n e n t i a l ,s o that the number density at timet is given by n , t d 8 c3 2d eh kBT t 1 T t T tf a tf a t . 52 Thus the distribution of photon energies retains the black body form even afer the photons went out of equilbrium with matter, but with a temperature that decreases with time as T a 1. In general, if some particle speciesi dropped out of thermal equilibrium with decoupled from the hot plasma at some timetf , its temperature at that time is approximately equal to the photon temperature at that timeTf T tf , where hot plasma refers now to all relativistic species including photons which we indicate asT or sometimes justT . After decoupling, the mean interaction rate of the particle drops below the expansion rateH, and the particle moves on a geodesic. As we have seen the momentum of a particle scales as p a 1 due to Hubble drag, which is valid for both relativistcic and non relativistic species. Since the relative momenta are conserved as we ve just seen for the example of the CMB, 16 Localtend equilibrium of 0 va\u00e1 the actual distribution function att t f can be written as f p, t f p a t a tf ,t f . 53 In other words, the form of the distribution function is frozen in the moment the particles decouple from the hot plasma, and the only thing that evolves with time is the temperature of that distributionTi. If a species is still relativistic after decoupling such thatE pc,t h e nw eh a v e f p, t g 2 3 exp pc kBTi 1 1 Ti t Tf a tf a t . 54 Thus, as we ve just seen for the CMB, the distribution of a decoupled, relativistic species is self similar to that of a relativistic species in thermal equilibrium, but with a temperature Ti t . Note that this does not necessarily equal to the temperature of the hot plasma at this later timet,a sw es h a l ls e ei nam o m e n t . If the species is already non relativistic when it decouples, its energy is given byE mc2 p2 2m,a n ds i n c ekBT mc2 we can ignore the 1t e r ms ot h a tt h ed i s t r i b u t i o nf u n c t i o ni s Maxwell Boltzmann f p e E p kBT . 55 where we have assumed \u00b5 kBT 1 or f p, t g 2 3 exp mc2 kBTf exp p2 2mkBTi , 56 which is the Maxwell Boltzmann distribution. Note however that because of the di erentp2 dependence in the exponential, and thep a 1 dependence, this implies that the tempera ture of this decoupled distribution scales di erently as Ti Tf a tf a t 2 . 57 We derived this scaling for temperature previously from kinetic theory by noting thatkBT mhv2i and v a 1.I ti si n t u i t i v et h a tt h i sh o l d sf o rt h et e m p e r a t u r eo fd e c o u p l e dp a r t i c l e s as well since they are described by a frozen in Maxwell Boltzmann distribution, which is the origin of kinetic theory. It is also immediately evident from the fact thatn t g 2 3 R f p, t d3p and the p a 1 scaling that the number density of decoupled particles in the relativistic and non relativistic regime is n t a tf a t 3 neq tf , 58 to prove this just usep a 1 and eqn. 53 which impliesn a 3,a se x p e c t e d . 17 day 3.8 Entropy To describe the evolution of the universe it is useful to track a conserved quantity. As we will see, in cosmology entropy is more informative than energy. It is easy to show that the entropy is conserved in LTE, as you showed on the homework. According to the second law of thermodynamics, the total entropy of the universe only increases or stays constant. Since there are far more photons than baryons in the universe, the entropy of the universe is dominated by the entropy of the photon bath at least as long as the universe is su ciently uniform . Any entropy production from irreversible processes is therefore totally insigni\ufb01cant relative to the total entropy. To a good approximation, we can therefore treat the expansion of the universe as adiabatic, so that the total entropy of the universe stays constant even if di erent particles species have dropped out of equilibrium at various times. The entropy density is de\ufb01ned by s S V , 59 and you demonstrated in the homework that this is a conserved quantity, i.e. sa3 c o n s t a n t. 60 We brie\ufb02y review how this is derived. The \ufb01rst lawof thermodynamcs can be written dS V,T 1 T dU PdV 1 T d T V P T dV . 61 In general the di erential ofS can be written dS V,T S V dV S T dT. 62 Reading o the partial derivatives by comparing eqns. 61 and 62 , and applying the intergrability condition 2S V T 2S T V , 63 yields dP dT T P T T . 64 Now rewriting the \ufb01rst law as dS 1 T dV Vd PdV 1 T dV Vd PdV Vd P Vd P 1 T d P V V T2 P dT d P V T , 65 18 where the second line used eqn. 64 . Since the entropy must be stationary in LTE,dS 0 , this then implies S P V T c o n s t a n t. 66 Since the total entropy should be an extensive quantityS V , we can choose this constant to be zero. Thus the entropy density iss S V s P T . 67 Now what about the time evolution ofs.W e l l w e k n o w t h a t i n L T E t h e e n t r o p y i s s t a t i o n a r y dS 0 . T h u si fS sV then dS da ds daV sdV da 0 1 s ds da 1 V dV da s a 3 or sa3 const 68 where in the last equality we used thatV a3. For a relativistic speciesi in LTE we have seen see eqn. 37 and eqn. 38 that only relativistic particles contribute signi\ufb01cantly to the energy density and pressure and that i 2 30 3c3 gi kBTi 4 Pi i 3 , 69 which implies that si 2 2 45 3c3 gi kBTi 3 70 or summing over all speciesi s X i si X i 2 2 45 3c3 gi kBTi 3 2 2 45 3c3 g?S T kBT 3, 71 where T is the photon bath temperature, and we have de\ufb01ned theefective number of degrees of freedom in entropy, g?S T X bosons gi Ti T 3 7 8 X fermions gi Ti T 3 . 72 Notice that g?S is equal to g? in eqn. 45 only when all the relativistic species are in equilibrium at the same temperature. From now on we will simly take T T as the temperature of the universe. Conservation of entropy has several important consequences, which we know brie\ufb02y discuss. Scaling ofT with scale factora With our de\ufb01nition ofg?S conservation of entropy can be written g?S T T3a3 c o n s t T g 1 3 ?S T a 1, 73 19 which follows simply fromsa3 c o n s t c o n s e r v a t i o no fe n t r o p y a n dt h ed e \ufb01 n i t i o no f g?S T a b o v e . A tt e m p e r a t u r e sa w a yf r o mp a r t i c l em a s st h r e s h o l d st h r e s h o l d sg?S T is approximately constant and thusT a 1 as we expect for radiation. The factor of g 1 3 ?S T accounts for the fact that whenever a particle species becomes non relativistic freezes out and disappears, its entropy is transferred to the other relativistic species still present in the thermal plasma, causingT to thus descrease slightly less slowly than a 1 sometimes this is called heating . We will see an example of this in the next section. Entropy is a useful reference quantity for number densities Becase s a 3, the number of particles in a comoving volume is therefore proportional to the number density ni divided by the total entropy density Ni ni s . 74 If particles are neither produced nor destroyed, thenni a 3,a n dNi is constant. This is very useful when we describe decoupled relics which are frozen in. The point is that because the number of degrees of freedomg? could be changing throughout the radiation dominated phase see Fig. 2 the expansion history, the temperature evolution, and the total number of photons are not simple functions ofa or time, and not that easy to relate to the number of CMB photons today which we know well . The equation above says thatNi is the number of particles per unit total entropy, and if particles are conserved say after decoupling since total entropy is conserved, it is then trivial to determine the number density of relics at timet t0,b ys i m p l y multiplying the present day value of the entropy densitys0 by Ni. Another example is the total baryon number. I can computenB,0 s0 today and this has to be equal to the total baryon number just after the epoch of baryogenesisnB s nb n b s since baryons don t decay away . Relativistic hot relics are comparable in number to CMB photons Finally, we saw earlier eqn. 58 that for any decoupled species we can write, n t a tf a t 3 neq tf . 75 If the species is relativistic when it decouples its number density is, from eqn. 36 , n g kBT 3 3 2 3c3 1b o s o n s 3 4 fermions . 76 For the moment absorb the factor of 1 or 3 4i n t os o m ege where ge g for bosons and ge 3 4 g for fermions, whereg is here the degeneracy factor of the decoupled species. Then we can compare the number density of a relativistically decoupled species 20 __ to that of the CMB photonsnCMB at some later timet t f n t nCMB t neq tf nCMB t a tf a t 3 ge g Tf T 3 a tf a t 3 , 77 where T T t i st h et e m p e r a t u r eo ft h ep h o t o n sa n dg 2i st h ed e g e n e r a c yf a c t o r for photons. But now we can use entropy conservation eqn. 73 to write g?S Tf T3 f a3 f g?S T T3a3 Tf T 3 a tf a t 3 g?S T g?S Tf . 78 Plugging this in above \ufb01nally gives n t nCMB t ge 2 g?S T g?S Tf . 79 This illustrates that the number density of any relic background of relativistic particles is comparable to the number density of CMB photons. Note that this equation also remains valid even if the particles later become non relativistic by redshifting away their energy and momentum such thatkBT tNR mc2 some time after decoupling where tNR t f . 4 Neutrino Decoupling Neutrinos are fermions spin 1 2p a r t i c l e s t h a ti n t e r a c to n l yv i at h ew e a kf o r c ea n dg r a v i t y . They are electrically neutral and have a massm c2 . 0.1e V i . e .. 2 10 7 times smaller than the electron such that they will esentially always be relativistic. There areN three \ufb02avors of neutrinos electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos, and tau neutrinos, although only the electron neutrinos take part in electromagnetic interactions. Since neutrinos are spin 1 2 fermions we expect their degeneracy factorg to be g 2. However, only one of these spin states, so calledleft handed or active neutrinos have ever been observed, so we will assume g 1. Neutrinos with the other spin state are calledright handed or sterile neutrinos, which are hypothetical particles which are postulated to interact only via gravity but not via the fundamental interactions of the Standard Model. Sterile neutrinos have been advocated as possible candidates for the dark matter. In what follows we focus on the active neutrinos which decoupled around 1s after the Big Bang and calculate the temperature of the cosmic neutrino background, which we argued previously has a temperatureT 4 11 TCMB. Neutrinos maintain thermal equilibrium with the primordial plasma through interactions 21 Figure 4 Thermal history through electron positron annihilation. Neutrinos are decoupled and their temperature redshifts simply asT a 1.T h e e n e r g y d e n s i t y a n d e n t r o p y o f the electron positron pairs are transferred to the photon gas whose temperature therefore redshifts more slowly,T g 1 3 ?S T a 1. Figure taken from Baumann such as p e n e p e n e n p e e e e e e e e e e 80 down to a thermal energy of 1 MeV, which corresponds roughly to 1 second after the Big Bang. Below this energy threshold these reactions become ine cient and they decouple. We can calculate roughly the 1 MeV scale of decoupling in the following way. Using eqn. 5 with vrel c, since the tiny neutrino mass guarantees they will be relativistic we will check this , one gets H n c H 81 22 o Noting thatH T2 Mpl recall thatH2 a 4 for a radiation dominated universe, and T a 1,s o H T2 , that GFT2 where GF is Fermi s constant, andn T3 for a relativistic species, gives H n c H G2 F c 6 MPlc2 kBT 3 kBT 1M e V 3 . 82 Thus when kBT 1 MeV decoupling occurs.

As a result electrons and positrons will be exponentially supressed, i.e. according to our calculation for a non relativistic species see eqn. 41 ne ge mkBT 2 2 3 2 e mec2 kBT . 84 The energy density and entropy of the electrons and positrons is transferred to the photon bath, but not to the neutrinos, which decoupled earlier. The photons are thus heated relative to the neutrinos, which is to say that the decoupled neutrino temperature decreases as a 1, whereas the photon temperture decreases more slowly, as shown in Fig. 4. The slower decrease is a direct result of the fact that the conserved quantity is the entropy, and hence T g 1 3 ?S T a 1 and so the photon temperature decreases more slowly thana 1 precisely because g?S T i sd e c r e a s e dw h e nt h ee l e c t r o n sa n dp o s i t r o nd e g r e e so ff r e e d o mv a n i s h . B u t the neutrinos do not feel the impact of this heating because they already froze out earlier. We now determine what the neutrino temperature should be explicitly using the conservation of entropy. At a certain scale factora1 prior toe e annihilation and neutrino decoupling, photons, electrons positrons, and neutrinos were all in equilibrium at temperatureT a1 , which we will denote asT 1.A tt h i se p o c ht h ee n t r o p yd e n s i t yh a dt h ev a l u e s a1 2 2 45 3c3 g?S T 1 kBT 1 3, 85 where g?S T 1 2 z photons electrons positrons z 7 8 2 2 7 8N g g z neutrinos anti neutrinos , 86 23 43 2 where N is the number of neutrino \ufb02avors andg is the neutrino degeneracy factor. Note that we have assumed the same temperatureT 1 for all particles since they are all in equilibrium with the thermal bath ata1. Now consider some later scale factora2 after e e annihilation and hence also after neutrino decoupling. Now the electrons and positrons are exponentially rare and the total entropy density is s a2 2 2 45 3c3 g?S T 2 kBT 2 3, 87 where g?S T 2 2 T 2 T 2 3 z photons neutrinos anti neutrinos z 7 8N g g T T 2 3 2 7 4N g T T 2 3 , 88 where we note that there are two relevant temperatures ata2,t h et e m p e r a t u r eo ft h et h e r m a l bath T 2,a n dt h ed e c o u p l e dn e u t r i n ot e m p e r a t u r eT .

Whereas, what we desire is a relationship between two temperatures, the decoupled neutrino temperatureT and the temperature of the CMB. Note that sincea2 is after electron positron annihilation, and neutrino decoupling, only the two photon degrees of freedom occupy the so called thermal bath, in other words, we just have a thermal bath of photons coupled to baryons and leptons, but recall that non relativistic particles contribute no signi\ufb01cant energy or entropy and decoupled neutrinos which travel along geodesics . After this point the photon temperatureT a a 1 all the way up to the present epoch since there will be no further changes in the number of relativistic degrees of freedom, i.e. T 2 is just the CMB temperature ata2.B u t b y t h e s a m e r e a s o n i n g ,T 2 6 a1 a2 T 1 e.g. see Fig. 4 . So in order to eliminateT 1 we need to use the fact that the neutrinos are just traveling along geodesics and not interacting with anything anymore. This means that their energy is simply being redshifted away by Hubble drag, i.e.T a since the timea1 at which they were in thermal equilibrium. An equivalent way to state exactly the same thing is to say 24 \u02c7 that their entropy isseparately conservedsince they decoupled, that is s T3 and s a3 c o n s t T a 1, 91 which implies T a1 a2 T 1, 92 Using this in eqn. 90 \ufb01nally gives T T 4 11 1 3 , 93 where we have substitutedT 2 T given our realization above that this is just the CMB temperature which evolves asT a 1 up to the present. The expression above remarkably does not depend onN or g although the energy density does . Plugging in numbers we \ufb01nd that forT 0 2 .725 K, we getT 0 1 .945 K. Using the expressions for energy density in eqn. 37 , one can easily show 7 8N g 4 11 4 3 , 94 where is the energy density of the CMB. We used these two contributions, CMB and neutrinos, to determine the total radiation energy density today r,0 7 .8 10 34 gc m 3 or r,0 8.6 10 5, 95 in a past lecture. 5 The Boltzmann Equation Thus far we have not dealt with the possibility of departues from LTE. We have either assumed LTE, or as in the case of neutrino decoupling, used entropy conservation to relate di erent times in the universe s thermal history where some departure from LTE ocurred. But in order to treat other fundamental issues in the Universe s thermal history like the possibility of dark matter being athermal relic, the recombination of electrons with protons at decoupling, and the synthesis of the light elements, we need to be able to understand departures from equilibrium. The formal tool to describe the evolution beyond equilibrium is the Boltzmann equation, which appears extraordinarily simple although solutions can be incredibly complicated. For some species of particlei it reads dfi dt Ci f . 96 Here fi is the one particle distribution function andCi f i st h ec o l l i s i o n a lt e r m5 that depends on fi,a sw e l la sa l lo t h e rd i s t r i b u t i o nf u n c t i o n sfj which particle i can interact with. Note 5Because Ci depends on a set of functions it is actually formally a functional. 25 i that Ci f m u s tn a t u r a l l yd e p e n do nt h ec r o s s s e c t i o n sa n dr e l a t i v em o m e n t ao fa l lo ft h e s e particles, and will thus in general involve integrals over their respective distribution functions. Thus for a set ofN di erent particle species, the Boltzmann equation is actually a set of N coupled integrodi erential equations for the full set of phase space distribution functions fi.F o r t u n a t e l y ,f o rm a n yp r a c t i c a lc o s m o l o g i c a la p p l i c a t i o n s ,t h e r ea r ew a y st os i m p l i f yt h e calculations. The one particle distribution function above is a function of timet,o ft h ep a r t i c l ep o s i t i o n x and the momentap, f x, p,t . But note thatx and p are themselves functions of time because of the particle motion. Thus the time derivative that we wrote above is actually a convective derivative analogous to in \ufb02uid mechanics, and it actually becomes dfi dt fi t dx dt r xfi dp dt r pfi. 97 In the current cosmological context, we can simplify this derivative in a few ways. First note that by homogeneityrxfi 0 ,a sw ea r g u e dp r e v i o u s l yw h e nd i s c u s s i n ge q u i l i b r i u m distribution functions.

This form of the Boltzman equation in terms ofni for a homogenous and isotropic universe 6You may have noticed that there is a missing degeneracy factorgi here. Just assume we have incorporated that into the distribution functionfi 7This is relatively straightforward to show, i.e. you get terms like R dp4 p3d f dp, and uv part of the integration by parts vanishes provided thatf p ! 0 as p !1 as any well behaved distribution function should. 26 becomes even more intuitive if we write it as 1 a3 d nia3 dt Z d3p 2 3 Ci f C0 i nj . 102 In this form it lends itself to an intuitive interpretation. In the absence of collisionsC0 0 , the Boltzman equation indicates thatnia3 is a conserved quantity. Since n represents a physical proper number density, this states that the universal Hubble expansion causes the volume of a region containing a \ufb01xed number of particles to grow asa3,a n dh e n c et h e physical number density of these particles falls o asa 3.E q u i v a l e n t l y w e c a n s a y t h a t i n the absence of collisions the comoving number densityN na3 is conserved. Sometimes we will describe this collisionless scenario by saying that the particles are traveling along geodesics , or expanding with the Hubble \ufb02ow . The collisions with other particlesnj, encapsulated in the collision termC0 i nj , causes departures from these geodesics. Let us now consider the impact of these collisions. Because interactions between three or more particles are very unlikely, for concreteness let us focus our attention on the number densityn1 of a single particle species 1, and that the only process a ecting the abundance of this species is an annihilation with species 2, producing two particles, which we will call 3 and 4. Similarly the inverse process can also occur 3 and 4 can also combine to produce particles 1 and 2. We can represent this reaction as 1 2 3 4 . 103 Clearly the rate of change in the abundance of species 1 is given by the di erence betweeen the rates for producing and eliminating the species. For this simple case the collision term simpli\ufb01es and we can write the Boltzmann equation as8 1 a3 d n1a3 dt T n1n2 T n3n4. 104 The right hand side can be understood as follows. The \ufb01rst term, n1n2,d e s c r i b e st h e rate of destruction of species 1, whereas the second term, n3n4 describes its creation rate when 3 and 4 come together. It is intuitive that the destruction rate is proportional ton1 and n2 and the creation rate proportional ton3 and n4.T h e p a r a m e t e r T c a nb ew r i t t e n as T h vi, 105 where is the interaction cross section for the 1 2a n n i h i l a t i o nr e a c t i o nt h a tp r o d u c e s 3 4p a r t i c l e s ,a n dv is the relative velocity between the projectile particles 1 and the target particles 2. The angle brackets indicate that we are using the appropriate velocity 8This equation is actually an approximation. See Dodelson 3.1, Piatella 3.8, or Kolb and Turner 5.1 for the details of what is actually being assumed here. We are essentially assuming that all the reactants have a Maxwell Boltzmann distribution and are coupled to the thermal bathT. For example if the reaction was e e , then the charge of the electrons and positrons and electromagnetic interactions enforce kinetic equilibrium between them and the thermal bath. The Maxwell Boltzmann assumption is equivalent to saying the occupation numbers of all the particle species are low, i.e. we are neglecting Fermi blocking and Bose enhancement e ects. 27 distribution averaged cross section, and it is intuitive that this should be a function of the temperature of the thermal bathT. Now we can relate T t o T by noting that if the system were in thermal equilibrium, the left hand side of the Boltzmann equation would have to be zero. This is a common trick in statistical mechanics where you hypothetically take the system to thermodynamic equilibrium to determine the relationship between forward and backward reaction rates. Speci\ufb01cally it allows you to express the ratio of forward and backward reaction rates as ratios of equilibrium number densities. In this other context it goes by the name of thelaw of mass actionand the principle ofdetailed balance. The beauty of this trick is that even though we are discussing a non equilibrium situation, we can still obtain a realtionship between forward and backward rates, by insisting that they be equal in equilibrium. Applying this argument to the case at hand we \ufb01nd that the relationship between T a n d T h vi must be n0 1n0 2 n0 3n0 4 h vi, 106 where n0 i are the number densities in thermal equilibrium which we calculated previously. Thus we can recast the Boltzmann equation as 1 a3 d n1a3 dt h vin1n2 1 n3n4 n1n2 n0 3n0 4 n0 1n0 2 . 107 6 Dark Matter and Thermal Relics We will now discuss the idea that dark matter could be a thermal relic of the Hot Big Bang. The idea here is that at some point in the Universe s thermal history dark matter was in thermal equilibrium with particles from the standard model which make up the photon bath, and that it satis\ufb01ed H. As the universe expanded and cooled this reaction eventually freezes out when H, and we are left with arelic abundance of cold dark matter particles. If we can calculate this abundance, we can put constraints on the cross section and mass of the dark matter particles by requiring that this abundance match the amount of cold dark matter in the universe determined from cosmological observations. This topic is obviously speculative because it requires that we make assumptions about the physical nature of the unknown dark matter particles. For concreteness, we will focus on the hypothesis that dark matter is composed ofweakly interacting massive particles WIMPs . Consider the following process X X l l, 108 where X represents the dark matter particle andl is a lepton. The Boltzman equation for the number density ofX, nX,i s 1 a3 d nXa3 dt h vinXn X 1 nXn X n0 Xn0 X 1, nln l n0 l n0 l . 109 28 We will assume that thel particles are in thermal equilibrium with the photon bath, and thus we can writen0 l nl.F u r t h e r w e w i l l n e g l e c t a n y p a r t i c l e a n t i p a r t i c l e a s s y m e t r y f o r the dark matter and simply writenX n X.T h ee q u a t i o na b o v et h e ns i m p l i \ufb01 e st o 1 a3 d nXa3 dt h vin2 X 1 n0 X nX 2 . 110 At this point it is instructive to recast the Boltzmann equation by de\ufb01ningcomoving nubmer densitiesNi nia3,w h i c hs e r v e st or e m o v et h ed i l u t i o no fn u m b e rd e n s i t yd u e to the universal expansion. With this we can write d ln NX d ln a a H a 1 N0 X NX 2 111 where we have de\ufb01ned the interaction rate nXh vi, 112 and used the fact that d dt H d d ln a. 113 Finally, note that if we consider times when the number of degrees of freedom are not changing, thena 1 T, we can also equivalently adopt a new time coordinate that highlights when interesting things are expected to happen, namely when the dark matter particle of mass m transitions from being relativistic to non relativistic. For this calculation we are most interested in cold dark matter, which is to say acold thermal relicthat decouples from the photon bath when it is non relativistic, although in the homework you will consider a hot thermal relic,w h i c hi sas p e c i e st h a td e c o u p l e sw h e ni ti ss t i l lr e l a t i v i s t i c . W e know that the number density of a particle will be exponentially suppressed when it goes non relativistic, resulting in a similar suppression of , and ultimately decoupling. This motivates us to de\ufb01ne x mc2 kBT , 114 where m is the mass of the dark matter particle. Becausex T 1 a,i ta l s oc o n s t i t u t e s at i m ec o o r d i n a t e ,b u tam o r eu s e f u lo n es i n c ex 1h i g h l i g h t sw h e nt h ep a r t i c l ei sg o i n g non relativistic. Thus we can \ufb01nally write d ln NX d ln x x H x 1 N0 X NX 2 . 115 Note that NX nXa3 nXT 3 nXx3,i . e . s i n c et h eT a 1 we can equivalently think of NX as the rationX T3,o re q u i v a l e n t l ya st h er a t i onX s,w h e r es T3 is the entropy density of the thermal bath. You will see all variants of this rescaling in cosmology books, and we will switch to scaling by the entropy in just a moment. This form of the Boltzmann 29 equation for thermal relics has no analytic solution, and must be solved numerically which we will come to next, but \ufb01rst we discuss its qualitative behavior.

Relativistic DecouplingConsider early times when H and NX N0 X is setup. In the relativistic regime becausen0 X T3 a 3, N0 X does not change with time. So as decreases with the expansion and eventually crosses H,n o t h i n gh a p p e n ss i n c eN0 X is not a function of time andNX was closely tracking it previously. Although one was in equilibrium previously when H,i tw o u l db eg r o s s l yi n c o r r e c tt oc o n c l u d et h a to n ei ss t i l li ne q u i l i b r i u m when one transitions H since no interactions exist to maintain equilibrium. This is basically exactly the physical situation we described when we talked about a relativistic distribution function like the CMB, or the cosmic neutrino backbround being frozen in after decoupling. The equilibrium distribution function for the relativistic species is maintained after decoupling even though the species is no longer in thermal equilibrium. Non Relativistic Decoupling Recall that for a non relativistic species the equilibrium number density is n0 X mkBT 2 2 3 2 e mc2 kBT , 116 and usingx mc2 kBT , N0 X n0 Xa3 x3 2e x, 117 and thus N0 X transitions to a rapidly declining function ofx time when x 1, and the particle becomes non relativistic, as illustrated by the dashed curve in Fig. 5. Thus in order for NX to track the equilibriumN0 X the left hand side of eqn. 115 must therefore be a large 30 Figure 5 A schematic illustration of particle freeze out. At high temperatures,kBT mc2, the particle abundance tracks its equilibrium value. At low temperatures,kBT mc2, the particles freeze out and maintain a density that is much larger than the Boltzmann suppressed equilibrium abundance. Figure from Baumann. negative number d ln NX d ln x 1. 118 This is fully consistent with a scenario where H 1, because thenNX can still closely track N0 X,m a k i n gt h et e r mi nb r a c k e t ss m a l l 0, but nevertheless compensated by the product with a large number H 1. However this cannot be maintained forever, because the equilibrium abundance is being exponentially suppressed ultimately there will come at i m ew h e nt h eNX particles are so rare that they cannot \ufb01nd each other fast enough to maintain equilibrium. In other words, the exponential decline ofN0 X will drive H ! 1, there will then be no way ford ln NX d ln x to stay large enough to keep up with the rapidly changing N0 X t h ea c t u a la b u n d a n c eNX cannot keep up and there must be a departure from equilibrium. Once H is reached, N0 X NX,a n dt h et e r mi nb r a c k e t sb e c o m e s negligible and we have d ln NX d ln x H 1 1 1 9 There is therefore a critical time when the reaction rate drops low enough that particles are simply conserved as the universe expands the particles havefrozen out.T h u s w e c a n write that N a !1 N H 1 . 120 Fig. 5 provides a schematic illustration of particle freeze out. 31 Let s now do a more quantitative analysis to con\ufb01rm this qualitative description and estimate the mass density in a cold thermal relic. As we mentioned in 3.8, it is often advantageous to work with the ratio of number density to entropy density owing to the fact that the total entropy of the universe is conserved. Recall that the total entropy density can be written s 2 2 45 3c3 g?S T kBT 3. 121 We thus de\ufb01ne the following quantities Y nX s ,Y eq n0 X s , 122 allowing us to write the Boltzmann equation as dY dt sh vi Y 2 Y 2 eq 123 Again, since most of the interesting dynamics will take place whenkBT mc2 we adopt the more convenient time coordinatex mc2 kBT.T o r e w r i t e t h e t i m e d e r i v a t i v e i n t e r m s o f x we note that dx dt d dt mc2 kBT x T dT dt Hx, 124 where we have assumed thatT a 1.R e c a l lt h a ti ng e n e r a lT3a3g?S T c o n s t ,s ow ea r e assuming that no major changes in the number of degrees of freedom occur over the times relevant to this particle freeze out so that we can writeg?S const g?S m . Since we are assuming that we are deep in the radiation dominated era recall thatH2 a 4 and hence H a 2 T2 x 2 so we can write H H m x2 , 125 where H m H x 1 is the Hubble parameter corresponding to a thermal energy kBT mc2.W et h e n\ufb01 n a l l ya r r i v ea tt h es o c a l l e dRiccati equation, dY dx x2 Y 2 Y 2 eq , 126 where 2 2 mc2 3h vig?S m 45H m 3c3 . 127 In this case chemical equilibrium would simply implyY Yeq and from eqn. 117 we know that Yeq ! 0f o rx !1 .O n t h e o t h e r h a n d , w e a l s o e x p e c t a s p e r t h e q u a l i t a t i v e d i s c u s s i o n above thatY attains an asymptotic value which we callY1 and with which we shall calculate the present abundance of dark matter. The departure from equilibriumY Yeq implied by the Boltzmann equation solution is what we described asfreeze out and, as we discussed, it takes place approximately when H. 32 Figure 6 Abundance of dark matter particles as the temperature drops below the mass, i.e. x mc2 kBT . Figure from Baumann. A numerical solution to eqn. 126 is shown in Fig. 6. In practical terms this is done by choosing a small initial value ofx xi and initalizing Y xi Yeq xi a n d\ufb01 x i n g to be a constant. Notice that parameterizes the interaction rate. One sees that the freeze out abundance Y1 decreases as increases. This makes intuitive sense larger interaction rates maintain equilibrium longer and H occurs deeper into the Boltzmann suppressed regime, resulting in a lower overall relic abundance. From inspection of Fig. 6 one observes also that the freeze out, i.e. when the abundance Y departs from Yeq,o c c u r sa r o u n dav a l u eo fxf 10.

At temperatures above about 1 eV, the universe still consisted of a plasma of free electrons and nuclei. Photons were tightly coupled to the electrons via Compton scattering, which in turn strongly interacted with protons via Coulomb scattering. There was very little neutral hydrogen. When the temperature became low enough, the electrons and nuclei combined to form neutral atoms, and the density of free electrons fell sharply. This event which formed the \ufb01rst atoms in the Universe is known asrecombination. As the electrons disappear onto atoms the scattering rate of photons o of electrons drops below the expansion rate and the photons decouple from the matter and the universe becomes transparent, which is known as decoupling. Today, these photons are observed as the cosmic microwave background, and the fact that decoupling happened so abruptly explains why we appear to see CMB photons orginating from a surface known as thelast scattering surface, as shown in Fig. 1 Figure 1 An observer is surrounded by a spherical last scattering surface. The photons of the CMB travel straight to us from the last scattering surface, being continuously redshifted. The distance back to the last scattering surface atz 1100 is almost equal to our particle horizon. Figure taken from Ryden. 1 For these two events, recombination and decoupling, the relevant interactions are p e H , e e . 1 Decoupling occurs just after recombination for the obvious reason that it is the disapearance of the electrons onto atoms that causes the Thompson scattering rate to plummett thus freeing the photons from the plasma. 1 Recombination 1.1 Baryon to Photon Ratio Previously we noted that if the particle number is not changing, then becausen a 3 and s a 3,t h e i rr a t i o ,t h en u m b e ro fp a r t i c l e sp e ru n i te n t r o p y , Ni ni s 2 is a conserved quantity which behaves like a comoving number density provided that particles are not being created or destroyed anymore. A useful application of this is to the number of baryons. Provided that baryon number nonconserving interactions if they even exist are occuring very slowly then nB s nB n B s, 3 and so this ratio is a constant since the epoch of baryogenesis when the baryon assymmetry was put in place. The ratio of baryons to entropy is related to an important quantity that we will use in studies of both recombination and Big Bang nucleosynthesis BBN , which is the baryon to photon ratio nB n 4 Recall that s 2 2 45 3c3 g?S T kBT 3 and n 2 kBT 3 3 2 3c3 , 5 which implies s 1 .80g?S T n . 6 Thus nB s s n 1 .80g?S T nB s . 7 Unlike nB s,i ng e n e r a lt h eb a r y o nt op h o t o nr a t i oi sn o tac o n s e r v e dq u a n t i t y .S p e c i \ufb01 c a l l y eqn. 6 states that when the number of degrees of freedom changes,g?S T , so will the total number of photons, and thus . However, we know that sincee e annihilation at around T 500 keV, or about 4s after the Big Bang, the number of degrees of freedom has not 2 changed and g?S T . 500 keV photons z 2 7 8N 2g T T 3 z neutrinos anti neutrinos 2 7 4 3 1 4 11 3 .91, 8 so we \ufb01nd that 7nB s 9 is also a conserved quantity since that time. We can calculate as follows. Recalling that 0 2 kBT0 4 2 30 3c3 , 10 we use eqn. 5 above to write n 0 0 30 3 4kBT0 , 11 and therefore nB0 n 0 B0 mpc2n 0 4kBT0 B0 30 3 mpc2 0 4kBT0 B0 30 3 mpc2 0 5 .5 10 10 B0h2 0.020 . 12 Note that the entropy of the Universe per particle is enormous and unlike any other physical system that we are used to considering. For example in a star like our sun thenB n 100. Even in the post collapse core of a supernovaenB n af e w . 1.2 Saha Equilibrium Recombination concerns two reactions. The \ufb01rst is the destruction of hydrogen atoms via the photoelectric e ect H ! p e , 13 which can occur if the photon has an energyh 13.6e V BH.T h i s r e a c t i o n c a n a l s o run in the opposite direction which is known asradiative recombination p e ! H . 14 When does the recombination phase transition, and the consequent decoupling of photons take place? We can obtain a quick and dirty estimate of the recombination temperature. One might argue that recombination must take place when the mean energy per photon in the cosmic microwave background falls below the ionization potential of the hydrogen atom, BH 1 3.6 eV. When this happens the average CMB photon is no longer able to photoionize hydrogen. Since the mean photon energy for a black body distribution isE 2.7kBT,t h i s 3 o 02 naive argument would suggest a recombination temperature of Trec BH 2.7kB 60, 000 K zrec 20, 000. 15 But we know the surface of last scattering is aroundzdec 1100, so what did we do wrong here? Obviously we ignored the fact that photons are not just at the mean temperature, but have a distribution functinof p . More importantly, this calculation neglects that photons outnumber baryons by a gigantic factor, namely 1 2 109.T h u s a n y n e w l y f o r m e d a t o m will be surrounded by over a billion photons, and it is thus not the mean energy of those photons that matters, but whether a photon in the extreme tail of the distribution is still energetic enough to ionize hydrogen. Apparently the temperature actually needs to be much lower for atomic hydrogen to survive, such that even among 2b i l l i o np h o t o n sp e rb a r y o n we cannot \ufb01nd one photon energetic enough to ionize hydrogen. What we have learned is that the recombination process, or more precisely the relative fraction of hydrogen which is ionized, has to depend on the baryon to photon ratio. Let s work out the mathematics behind this using the equilibrium distribution functions that we have learned about. We will make some simplifying assumptions here. First, we will assume the Universe is a pure hydrogen plasma so that we don t need to worry about Helium nuclei. We will learn in the next lecture that the universe is actually 10 Helium by number or about 25 Helium by mass, so this is not going to be a big correction, but it does simplify the math. Second, and more important, we will calculate the fraction of the total hydrogen which is ionized assuming LTE. This turns out to be a good approximation at early times, but then breaks down as recombination proceeds, because the reactions above fall out of chemical equilibrium. We will work out the full non equilibrium treatment next. Our goal is to follow thefree electron fractionor ionized fraction as a function of time Xe ne np nH ne nB np nB , 16 where our assumption of a pure hydrogen plasma impliesnB np nH and np ne. Consider LTE between the electrons, protons, neutral atoms, and photons. In this case we can write the reactions above as p e H . 17 LTE implies that all particles obey the equilibrium distributions we derived previously, and that we also have chemical equilibrium \u00b5p \u00b5e \u00b5H, 18 where we have used the fact that photons have zero chemical potential\u00b5 0. Now that we are interested in chemical equilibrium, we need to retain the chemical potential in all the distribution functions. 4 Figure 2 Free electron fraction as a function of redshift.

With this, eqn. 20 becomes nH n2 e 2 2 mekBT 3 2 eBH kBT . 22 Now note that the left hand side nH n2 e 1 nB 1 Xe X2 e , 23 and we can write the total baryon density in terms of the baryon to photon ratio nB n 2 kBT 3 3 2 3c3 , 24 where we used eqn. 5 above. We then arrive at the so calledSaha equation, 1 Xe X2 e 2 3 2 2 kBT mec2 3 2 eBH kBT . 25 Fig. 2 shows the the redshift evolution of the free electron fraction as predicted both by the Saha equation above, and the more exact full non equilibrium treatment using the Boltzmann see below . The Saha approximation, which assumes LTE, correctly identi\ufb01es the onset of recombination, but it is clearly insu cient if the aim is to determine the relic density of elec trons after freeze out, since the Saha solution is just based on equilibrium thermodynamics and knows nothing about the reaction rate relative to the Hubble time. 1.3 Time of Recombination Let us de\ufb01ne the recombination temperatureTrec as the temperature whereXe 0 .1, that is when 90 of the electrons have combined with protons to form neutral hydrogen. This choice is obviously somewhat arbitrary, but given that the Saha solution saysXe plummets exponentially, it won t matter much what we choose. Furthermore this is a regime where LTE still appears to be a reasonably valid assumption given the curves in Fig. 2. We \ufb01nd Trec 3600 K 0.3e V kB . 26 Thus we con\ufb01rm that 3600 K 60, 000 K 0.3e V 5e V a s w e a r g u e d e a r l i e r m u s t b e the case because photons outnumber baryons by such a large number, and we see that it is enforced in eqn. 25 whereXe depends on .

We can estimate the redshift of recombination as follows Trec T0 1 zrec , 28 and plugging in the temperature of the CMB todayT0 2 .7K , g i v e s zrec 1320. 29 Since we previously estimated that matter radiation equality is atzeq 3500, we conclude that recombination occurred in the matter dominated era. Using a t t t0 2 3 , 30 appropriate for a matter dominated universe, we can estimate the time of recombination to be trec t0 1 zrec 3 2 290, 000 yrs. 31 1.4 Electron Freeze Out In Fig. 2 we see that a residual ionization fraction of electrons freezes out when the interac tions in eqn. 17 become ine cient. To follow the free electron fraction after freeze out, we need to solve the Boltzmann equation, just as we did for the dark matter freeze out. One can obtain an order of magnitude estimate by applying the criterion T neh vi H T , 32 which you will do in the homework. Here the velocity averaged cross section is there combination rate coe cient.T h i s t u r n s o u t t o b e n o t c o m p l e t e l y t r i v i a l t o c a l c u l a t e . Ground state recombinations lead to production of an ionizing photon, and this photon im mediately ionizes a neutral atom. The net e ect of such a recombination is zero no new neutral atoms are formed this way. The only way for recombination to proceed is via capture to one of the excited states of hydrogen to a good approximation, this rate is h vi recc BH kBT 1 2 , 33 where rec 1 .27 10 24 cm2.I n t h e l a n g u a g e o f t h e P h y s i c s o f t h e I n t e r s t e l l a r a n d I n t e r galactic Medium Phys 233 , we want the case B recombination rate B T , for which the recombinations to the ground state which have no net e ect on the ionization equilibrium, are excluded from the rate coe cient calculation. 7 Recall that the Boltzmann equation reads 1 a3 d n1a3 dt h vin1n2 1 n3n4 n1n2 n0 3n0 4 n0 1n0 2 34 We can taken1 ne, n2 np ne, n3 nH,a n dn4 n n0 because photons always follow their equilibrium distribution both pre and post decoupling. Plugging these in we \ufb01nd 1 a3 d nea3 dt h vi n2 e n0 e 2 nH n0 H . 35 We will further make the approximation that nH n0 H 1. 36 Since we will be interested in times after freeze out whereXe 1a n dh e n c enH nB it is reasonable to set this term to unity. So we obtain 1 a3 d nea3 dt h vi n2 e n0 e 2 37 Writing thatne nBXe the left hand side is 1 a3 d nea3 dt 1 a3 d XenBa3 dt 1 a3 dXe dt nBa3 Xe d nBa3 dt nB dXe dt , 38 where the last equality used the fact thatnBa3 c o n s ti sj u s tt h ec o m o v i n gb a r y o nd e n s i t y , and henced nBa3 dt 0 .

Then the Hubble constant is just H z H0 p m0 1 z 3 2 H0 p m0 T T0 3 2 x 3 2 42 8 since T T0 1 z . So we can writeH x H x 1 x 3 2.

We can therefore immediately write down the electron freeze out abundance, as we did before X1 e xf 0 .9 10 3 xf 45 , 47 where we have plugged in numbers for xf xrec kBTrec BH 0.3e V 13.6e V 4 5 4 8 using the value of Trec 3 6 0 0 Kw ed e r i v e df r o mt h eS a h ae q u a t i o nb ya s s u m i n gt h a t recombination occurs when Xeq e 0 .1. This is reasonably close to the true value, but slightly overestimated. This residual abundance of electrons is important for two reasons. First, they are required to catalyze the formation of molecular hydrogen later on, and molecular hydrogen is crucial to cool gas to low enough temperatures so that the \ufb01rst stars can form. Second, as we will see momentarily, the photons stop scattering o of the electrons just afer recombination. However, because the photon to baryon ratio is so high 109,t h e s er a r es c a t t e r i n ge v e n t s between electrons and photons nevertheless continue to heat the electrons, which transfer this heat to the protons via Coulomb interactions. As a result, the temperature of the baryons remains coupled to that of the radiation and drops of asT a 1, instead of theT a 2 that a frozen out non relativistic gas would usually follow in the absence of interactions. Thus the temperature of the baryons follows the temperature of the CMB until much later times z 150 than recombination decoupling. 9 2 Photon Decoupling As stated earlier, photons are most strongly coupled to the primordial plasma through their scattering interactions with electrons e e , 49 which has an interaction rate given by ne T c XenB T c 50 where T 6 .65 10 23 cm2 is the Thompson cross section. Since ne,t h ei n t e r a c t i o n rate decreases as the density of free electrons drops. Photons and electrons decouple roughly when the interaction rate becomes smaller than the expansion rate, Tdec H Tdec . 51 Again using eqn. 43 fornB a 3 and eqn. 42 forH z i nam a t t e rd o m i n a t e du n i v e r s e , we can derive H 1 1 3Xe z b0h2 0.02 m0h2 0.15 1 2 1 z 1000 3 2 . 52 The redshift of decouplingzdec is de\ufb01ned to be that for which H 1. Note that in the above equation Xe is a function of redshift, which we have plotted in Fig. 2. One can see that Xe drops abruptly during recombination, the factor of 113 in the equation above is easily overcome. For this reason recombination and decoupling happen at roughly the same time. The redshift and time of decoupling are zdec 1090 53 tdec 380, 000 yr 54 After decoupling the photons stream freely. Observations of the cosmic microwave back ground today allow us to probe the conditions at last scattering. 10 Phys 236 Cosmology Lecture 9 Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Let us return toT 1M e V o r a b o u t 1 s a f t e r t h e B i g B a n g . P h o t o n s , e l e c t r o n s , p o s i t r o n s , neutrinos and anti neutrinos are in thermal equilibrium. The neutrinos are about to decou ple. Baryons are non relativistic and therefore much fewer in number than the relativistic species as expressed by the extremely small baryon to photon ratio 5 10 10. Neverthe less, we now want to study what happened to these trace amounts of baryonic matter. The total number of nucleons stays constant due to baryon number conservation. This baryon number can be in the form of protons and neutrons or heavier nuclei. Weak nuclear reactions may convert neutrons and protons into each other and strong nuclear reactions may build nuclei from them. In this lecture, we will learn how the light elements hydrogen s isotope deuterium, helium, and lithium were synthesized in the Big Bang. It turns out that the primordial synthesis of these elements provides one of the earliest and most stringest tests of the standard cosmology, and an important test of particle physics. As we will discuss, the present state of agreement between theory and observation indicates that the standard cosmology is a valid description of the universe at least back to times as early 10 2 sec after the Big Bang and temperatures as high as 10 MeV. In its full generality, BBN is a very complicated process involving many coupled Boltzmann equations to track all the nuclear abundances, informed by collision strengths for all of the nuclear reactions. In practice, however, two simpli\ufb01cations will make our life much easier 1. No elements heaver than helium. For reasons that we will explain, essentially no elements heavier than helium are pro duced at appreciable levels. So the only nuclei that we need to track are hydrogen and helium, and their isotopes deuterium, tritium, and3He. 2. Only neutrons and protons above 0.1 MeV. Above T 0.1 MeV only free protons and neutrons exist, while other light nuclei haven t been formed yet. Therefore, we can \ufb01rst solve for the neutron proton ratio and then use this abundance as the initial conditions for the synthesis of deuterium, helium, etc. At some level the zeroth order goal of this lecture is to provide a theoretical explanation for one number the ratio of the density of helium to hydrogen nHe nH 1 16 or by mass Y 4He B 1 4 1 1 Lightning Introduction to Nuclear Physics A single proton is a hydrogen nucleus, referred to as 1H or simply p 2 1 Ap r o t o na n dan e u t r o nm a k eu pd e u t e r i u m 2Ho r D. 3 One proton and two neutrons make tritium 3Ho r T. 4 Nuclei with two protons are helium these can have one neutron 3He or two neutrons 4He. 5 Thus unique elements have a \ufb01xed number ofZ protons, and isotopes of a given element have di ering numbers of neutrons. The total number of nucleons, i.e. neutrons and protons, in the nucleus, is known as theatomic numberor mass numberA,w h i c hi sl i s t e da sa superscript before the name of the element. The total mass of a nucleus withZ protons andA Z neutrons di ers slightly from the mass of the individual protons and neutrons alone. This di erence is called the binding energy, de\ufb01ned as BA Zmpc2 A Z mnc2 mAc2, 6 where mp and mn are the mass of the proton and neutron, respectively, andmA is the mass of the nucleus. For example, the mass of deuterium is 1875.62 MeV while the sum of the neutron and proton masses is 1877.84 MeV, so the binding energy of deuterium is 2.22 MeV. Although the nucleons have GeV mass energy, nuclear binding energies are typically in the MeV range, which explains why Big Bang nucleosynthesis occurs at temperatures a bit less than 1 MeV. The binding energyBA of a nucleus is the energy required to pull it apart into its component protons and neutrons. Equivalently, it is the energy released when a nucleus is fused together from individual protons and neutrons. I \ufb01nd it helpful to consider the analogy with ionization and recombination processes, which are typically more familiar. For example, we just studied the reaction p e H 7 where is a photon, and we know that photon energies in excess of the binding energy BH 1 3.6 eV are required to ionize hydrogen. This can be compared to the reaction which synthesizes deuterium p n D , 8 where in order to break D we require a gamma ray photon more energetic than the binding energy of Deuterium BD 2 .22 MeV. The deuteron is in fact not very tightly bound compared to other atomic nuclei. Fig. 1 plots the binding energy per necleuonBA A for atomic nuclei with di erent mass numbers. Note that4He has a very highBA A 7 . 0 7 or total binding energyBA 2 8.30 MeV making it relatively tightly bound compared to other light nuclei withA 10. The most tightly bound nuclei are those of56Fe, 58Fe, and 2 61Ni. Thus nuclei less massive than iron or nickel can release energy by fusion merging into heavier nuclei. Whereas nuclei more massive than iron or nickel can release energy by \ufb01ssion splitting into lighter nuclei. Finally, we will quantify abundances of the light elements via the mass fraction of a nuclear species A Z , XA nAA nB nB nn np X A AnA, 9 where P A XA 1a n dnB n is the total number density of baryons whether bound or free and is the baryon to photon ratio.

Note that kBTnuc is the temperature at which NSE predicts an order unity abundance given the universe s very small baryon to photon ratio . 2 Nuclear Statisitcal Equilibrium Similar to our approach when discussing recombination, we will \ufb01rst derive the equilbrium abundances of several relevant species, and then consider how these equilbrium abundances di er from the full non equilibrium treatment using the Boltzmann equation, which correctly describes what happens when H. 2.1 Neutrons First let s consider neutrons and protons which constitute the basic building blocks for nucleosynthesis. Indeed, we will see that esentially all of the neutrons in the universe get incorporated into4He.

Figure 2 Numerical results for helium production in the early universe. Figure from Bau mann. As for the chemical potentials, consider the second reaction listed above. Chemical equilib rium implies \u00b5n \u00b5 \u00b5p \u00b5e \u00b5n \u00b5p \u00b5e \u00b5 . 13 So we can rewrite eqn. 11 as nn np e x p Q kBT \u00b5e \u00b5 kBT exp Q kBT , 14 5 where in the last approximation we used the fact that the chemical potential of electrons and neutrinos \u00b5 kBT 1. For electrons, you showed in the homework that this results from the charge neutrality of the universe and the extremely small baryon to photon ratio. For neutrinos this is an assumption that is very likely to be true1. Thus we see that forT 1 MeV, there are as many neutrons as protons. However, for T 1 MeV, the neutron fraction is exponentially suppressed as shown in Fig. 2. Recall that Q mn mp c2 1.30 MeV, thus protons are the lower energy bound state , and as the universe cools down it is not energetically favorable to have any neutrons around. This is exactly the same principle behind forming the \ufb01rst atoms during recombination, i.e. the bound state H is energetically preferred once you cool down enough. If the weak interactions would operate e ciently enough to maintain equilibrium inde\ufb01nitely, then the neutron abundance would drop to zero. Luckily, in the real world the weak interactions are not so e cient. To get the \ufb01nal freeze out abundancenn np we will need to do a full non equilibrium Boltzmann calculation, which we will come to momentarily. 2.2 Deuterium Now let s consider deuterium,2H, an isotope of hydrogen with one proton and one neutron. BBN takes place through a series of two body reactions, building heavier nuclei step by step. The essential \ufb01rst step is the fusion of a proton and neutron to form a deuteron p n D . 15 For the present calculation we will take the input neutron abundance to be a \ufb01xed initial condition, which is a reasonable assumption given that the freeze out neutron abundance is set in place before deuterium synthesis begins see Fig. 2 . Note again that the deuterium reaction has exactly the same form as the recombination photoionization reaction p e H . 16 In that context, we derived the Saha equation nH npne 2 2 mekBT 3 2 exp BH kBT , 17 which states that neutral hydrogen is favored in the limitkBT ! 0, whereas ionized hydrogen is favored in the limitkBT !1 . In analogy with our procedure for recombination, the assumption of chemical equilibrium for deuterium \u00b5p \u00b5n \u00b5D, 18 1The exact same calculation that you performed in the homework applies to neutrinos, implying\u00b5 kBT n n n . However, since the relic neutrino background has not been directly detected we cannot use the charge neutrality argument to estimate the di erence in the numbers of particles to anti particles as we did for the electron. So we are implicitly assuming that similar to the small Baryon numbernB n B the universe also has a small lepton number and thus n n n 1. 6 implies the relative numbers of free protons, free neutrons, and deuterons are given by a completely analogous equation nD npnn gD gngp mD mpmn 3 2 2 2 kBT 3 2 exp mp mn mD c2 kBT 6 2 mnkBT 3 2 exp BD kBT , 19 where in the last equality we used the de\ufb01nition of the binding energy of deuterium BD mp mn mD c2 2 .22 MeV, 20 plugged in the degeneracy factor for the deuteron spin 1,gD 3 ,t h ep r o t o na n dn e u t r o n gp gn 2 ,a n da g a i nu s e dt h ea p p r o x i m a t i o nmp mn mD 2i nt h em a s sr a t i oi n the pre factor. Thus we end up with an equation equivalent to the Saha equation which describes nuclear statistical equilibrium NSE . Similar to electron protons vs. atoms, we see that there should be no deuterium bound state in the limit ofkBT !1 ,b u t deuterium is favored in the limitkBT ! 0. Similar to our approach for recombination, let s obtain an estimate for the temperature Tnuc at which deuterium becomes favored. To do this we will de\ufb01ne the time of deuterium synthesis to be atnD nB 1, when the deuterium abundance is a number of order unity. In the next section we will learn that the freeze out neutron abundance when neutrons decouple before deuterium synthesis is nn nB 1 6 or np 0 .83nB 21 and even today 75 of all baryons in the universe are in the form of unbound protons. So we can approximiately takenn nB 6a n dnp nB which gives nD nB nB 2 mpkBT 3 2 exp BD kBT , 22 where we substitutedmnc2 mpc2 9 3 8.3 MeV. Similar to our approach for recombination we can express the baryon density in terms of the baryon to photon ratio nB n 2 kBT 3 3 2 3c3 , 23 and we \ufb01nally obtain XD nD nB kBT mpc2 3 2 exp BD kBT , 24 Not surprisingly, this equation has the exact same form as our equation for the ionized fraction Xe during recombination. As long asBD kBT is not too large, the pre factor dominates this expression. Recall that this pre factor is extremely small becuase of the small 5.5 10 10 baryon to photon ratio. As the temperature drops, bound states like deuterium or neutral atoms become 7 i i i i v o \u4e2a energetically favored. We can solve for the temperatuerTnuc at whichXD 1b yt a k i n gt h e natural log of both sides kBTnuc BD ln 1 1 .5l n mpc2 kBT . 25 Solving this equation we \ufb01nd kBTnuc 0.07 MeV BD 34. 26 The reason whykBTnuc is a factor of 30 lower than the binding energy is again because of the extremely large number of photons to baryons, which can be seen in the equation above. Indeed, the temperature is only logarithimically sensitive to ,b u tb e c a u s e is so small this nevertheless has a signi\ufb01cant e ect on the temperature at which we can form deuterium. Just like in the case of recombination, the interpretation is that because photons outnumber baryons by such a gigantic factor, there are many high energy photons than can immediately destroy nuclei that are formed when the temperature is around the binding energy. In order for it to be energetically favorable to form bound states like deuterium, we need to lower the temperature enough such that even the photons in the high energy tail of the distribution are not abundant enough to inhibit deuterium production. This is what is known as thedeuterium bottleneck.A t o m i c n u c l e i a r e b u i l t u p s e q u e n t i a l l y from lighter elements via two body reactions. This implies that helium nuclei cannot be formed directly from neutrons and protons, because the densities are too low and the time available is too short for reactions involving three or more incoming nuclei to occur at an appreciable rate. The small baryon to photon ratio inhibits the production of deuterium until the temperature drops well beneath its nuclear binding energy. At temperatures above 0.1 MeV, then, virtually all baryons are in the form of neutrons and protons. Around this time, deuterium and then immediately helium are produced, but the reaction rates are by this time too low to produce any heavier elements. We will come back to this point when we discuss full non equilibrium solutions. 2.3 General Treatment Given a nuclear species with mass numberA n p and chargeZ p,w h e r en n u m b e r of neutrons andp number of protons in the nucleus, its equilibrium number density is given by nA gA mAkBT 2 2 3 2 exp \u00b5A mAc2 kBT . 27 If nuclear reactions occur at a rate higher than the expansion rateH,t h e nc h e m i c a le q u i l i b rium is obtained. Although the weak force can convert protons into neutrons and vice versa, the total number of baryons is conserved in all of the interactions we will be concerned with here. This allows us to relate the chemical potential for the nucleus to that of protons and neutrons through \u00b5A Z\u00b5p A Z \u00b5n . 28 8 l We can divide eqn. 28 byT and exponentiate to obtain exp \u00b5A kBT e x p Z\u00b5p A Z \u00b5n kBT nZ p nA Z n 2 2 mBkBT 3A 2 2 A exp Zmpc2 A Z mnc2 kBT , 29 where we in the pre factor we have introduced the nucleon or baryon massmB mp mn mA A.

The binding energies for the \ufb01rst few light elements are listed in Table 2. Note that the equi librium abundances of all bound nuclei are negligible as long as free neutrons and protons are in equilibrium due to the small factor. Figure 3 The NSE mass fractions of all nuclear species withZ 6, for a neutron to proton ratio of 0.14. If the universe had expanded arbitrarily slowly, allowing all nuclear processes to reach equilibrium, then the vast majority of the protons and neutrons would become bound into helium 4 nuclei, and later into carbon 12. Figure from Hooper. 10 By taking the natural log of the general expression forXA in eqn. 32 , we \ufb01nd that theXA will be of order unity at temperatures satisfying Tnuc BA A 1 ln 1 1 .5l n mpc2 kBT , 35 which is the generalization of eqn. 35 for deuterium. We see that NSE predicts that Tnuc 0 .07 MeV for deuterium,Tnuc 0 .11 MeV for3He, Tnuc 0 .28 MeV for4He, and Tnuc 0 .25 MeV for12C. These values are listed in Table 2. For the sake of illustration, consider the following system of light elements withZ 6 neutrons, protons, deuterons, tritium, 3He nuclei, 4He nuclei, and the istopes of C,12C, 13C, and 14C nuclei. A solution to the NSE system of equations in eqn. 34 is shown in Fig. 3. We can clearly see that although the binding energies per nucleon are of the order of 1 to 8 MeV see Table 2 , the equilibrium abundance of nuclear species does not become of order unity until a temperature of order 0.3 MeV. This is due to the high entropy of the Universe, that is, the very small value of . Although for temperatures less than a few MeV nuclei are favored on energetic grounds, entropy considerations i.e. the extremely small baryon to photon ratio favor free nucleons, and the entropy of the Universe is very high. Another important thing to note from this simple example and eqn. 32 is that in NSE the most bound heavy elements are favored as the temperature is decreased which would be late times . This simple illustrative calculation was cuto at CarbonZ 6 ,a n dw es e et h a t if the universe had expanded arbitrarily slowly, allowing all nuclear processes adequate time to reach equilibrium, then the vast majority of the protons and neutrons would \ufb01rst become bound into helium 4 nuclei, and later into carbon 12. These two isotopes each stand out in part because of their high binding energies per nucleon see Table 2 and Fig. 1 . Had we extended this calculation to heavier elements we would \ufb01nd that they dominate at progressively later times. Indeed, NSE predicts that the end state of the nulceosynthesis should be that all the material in the Universe should be in some iron nickel alloy, since these are the most bound heavy elements from Fig. 1. The reason why fortunately! , this did not occur in reality is that the Universe departs from NSE. The important thing to note is that NSE knows nothing about reaction rates or our criteria H. When we assume NSE, we assume that the Universe has enough time to arrive at thermal and chemical equilbrium, and the relative abundances of states simply depend on their relative energies and the relative numbers of particles e.g. photons to baryons . In the next section, we consider the non equilibrium calculation that is required to determine the freeze out abundance of neutrons. 3 Neutron Freeze Out In this section we want to solve for the non equilibrium neutron proton ratio that constitutes the initial conditions for BBN. As we see in eqns. 10 weak interactions convert protons into neutrons, and these reactions stay in equilibrium atT 3M e V . A t l a t e r t i m e s l o w e r temperatures one must use the Boltzmann equation to track the neutron abundance. Our 11 goal in this section is to determine the neutron abundance Xn nn nn np nn nB , 36 at the temperatureTnuc 0.1M e V a t w h i c h w e e x p e c t f u s i o n o f t h e l i g h t e l e m e n t s t o s t a r t , based on our equilibrium estimtates in the last section. To track the evolution ofXn we recall the Boltzmann equation 1 a3 d n1a3 dt h vin1n2 1 n3n4 n1n2 n0 3n0 4 n0 1n0 2 . 37 Let s imagine a reaction like n e p e , 38 such that 1 neutron, 3 proton, and 2, 4 l e p t o n s ,a n dw ef u r t h e ra s s u m et h a tt h e leptons are in complete equilibriumne n0 e and n n0 , and since there are other reactions with other leptons we will henceforth just writen0 l .T h e e l e c t r o n s w i l l f o l l o w t h e i r e q u i l i b r i u m distribution because they are tightly coupled to the thermal bath via Thomson scattering. This may seem counter intuitive for neutrinos since they freeze out aroundkBT 1M e V indeed it is exactly the decline in e ciency of these reactions that causes neutrinos to freeze out but recall that a relativistic species maintains its equilibrium distribution during freeze out, so this is a valid assumption. We thus obtain a 3 d nna3 dt n0 l h vi npn0 n n0 p nn . 39 From eqn. 14 we know the ratio n0 n n0 p e x p Q kBT , 40 and we can de\ufb01ne np n0 l h vi, 41 as the rate of neutron! proton conversion since it multipliesnn in the loss term. If we rewrite nn on the left hand side asnn nn np Xn nBXn,t h e nb e c a u s ed a3nB dt 0 we \ufb01nally obtain dXn dt np 1 Xn e Q kBT Xn . 42 The equation above is a di erential equation for the time evolution ofXn,b u ti tc o n t a i n st h e temperature T and the reaction rate np,b o t ho fw h i c hh a v ec o m p l i c a t e dt i m ed e p e n d e n c i e s .

We will however ignore this complication when computing the freezeout abundance of neutrons. 13 \u3125 Figure 4 The neutron to proton ratio during the thermal freeze out of the weak interactions.

The \ufb01rst nucleus to form is therefore deuterium n p D . 56 Only when there is enough deuterium can the production of helium in signi\ufb01cant numbers commence via reactions like D p 3He D 3He 4He p 57 Because of thedeuterium bottleneck,w h i c hi st os a yt h a td e u t e r i u mp r o d u c t i o ni sd e l a y e d until Tnuc 0.07 MeV t 2 6 9 s ,h e l i u mp r o d u c t i o nt h u sh a st ow a i tf o rd e u t e r i u m . S i n c e the binding energy of helium is larger than that of deuterium see Table 2 , the Boltzmann factor eB kBT see eqn. 32 favors helium over deuterium. Indeed, in Fig. 2 we see that helium is produced almost immediately after deuterium begins to form. Thus virtually all of the remaining neutrons atT Tnuc t tnuc a r ep r o c e s s e di n t o4He. Since two neutrons go into one nucleus of4He, the \ufb01nal4He number density is equal to half of the neutron density at Tnuc,i . e .n4He nn Tnuc 2, so we can write Y X4He 4n4He nB 4nn 2 nn np 2 Xn Tnuc 2 0.12 0.24, 58 which is in agreement with the observed value ofY 1 4 discussed at the beginning of class. 15 \u70b9\u70b9 i \u82b1 Figure 5 Time and temperature evolution of all standard big bang nucleosynthesis SBBN relevant nuclear abundances.

Figure from Pospelov Pradler 2010, ARNP 60 539 68 Fig. 7 shows the result of a full numerical non equilibrium solution to the coupled Boltzmann equations for a network of light elements, which includes other heavy elements like6Li, and 7Be. Why wasn t12C or other heavy elements synthesized in the Big Bang like a naive NSE calculation see Fig. 3 might suggest? The answer is threefold Deuterium bottleneck The extremely small baryon to photon ratio implies that waiting for deuterium production delays the formation of the \ufb01rst nuclei toTnuc 0.07 MeV. By this time the two body reaction rates are too low to produce any heavier elements in signi\ufb01cant numbers. Helium is exceptionally tightly boundInspection of Fig. 1 illustrates that4He 16 0 constitutes a local maximum in the binding energy per nucleon. Recall that the Boltz mann factor eB kBT determines which bound states are preferred. The large binding energy of Helium means it can stick around as the preferred bound state for a long time e ectively terminiating BBN, because by the time the universe would be cool enough to prefer more tightly bound states the reaction rates are already too low and everything is frozen out. Lack of a stable istopesGlancing at Fig. 1 we see that there are no stable isotopes with atomic numberA 5o r A 8 . E x o t i ci s o t o p e sl i k e5He, 5Li, or 8Be are wildly unstable with extremely short half lives. This means once 4He is created, heavier elements cannot be produced via a reaction like 4He p ! 5X. 59 What about the fusion of two or more4He nuclei? In massive stars, with core tem peratures above 0.01 MeV, helium can fuse into carbon via the so called triple alpha process 4He 4He ! 8Be 60 followed by 8Be 4He ! 12C 2 . 61 The fact that8Be is unstable with a very short lifetime, however, makes this process very slow. It is e ective over the lifetime of a star, but not within the few minutes available for BBN. More generally, the lack of any stable nuclei withA 5o r A 8 and the fact that densities are too low and time available too short set by the Hubble expansion to allow three nuclei to \ufb01nd one another implies heavier elements are not created in signi\ufb01cant numbers. 5 Observations and Constraints on the Standard Model 5.1 Observations of Primordial Abundances The challenge of using observations to compare with BBN is that the early universe is not the only place where the number of elements are changed nucleosynthesis in stars forms heavy elements and can burn up primordial light elements. Nonetheless we can often tell when this is a problem, because heavy elements are only produced in signi\ufb01cant numbers in stars, so places where we see many heavy elements are clearly contaminated. Instead constraints can be placed by looking for low metallicity systems those with few heavy elements so that the observed abundances may better re\ufb02ect the primordial abundances metals in astrophysics are all the elements except hydrogen and helium . If the metallicity dependence of the abundance of interest can be judged, it may also be possible to extrapolate from observations to zero metallicity, even though we see no entirely uncontaminated systems. Deuterium M e a s u r e m e n t s o f t h e p r i m o r d i a l d e u t e r i u m a b u n d a n c e a r e p e r h a p s o u r single most powerful probe of the universe during its \ufb01rst few minutes. A major chal lenge in these determinations is the small binding energy of deuterium, which makes 17 it easily destroyed in stars. Strictly speaking, this means that any measurement of D Hi st e c h n i c a l l yal o w e r l i m i to nt h ep r i m o r d i a la b u n d a n c e . T h i sc a nb er e m e d i e d by measuring the deuterium abundance in regions devoid of metals and hence with little evidence of destruction by stellar nucleosynthesis. For this we rely on observa tions of high redshift i.e. very early environments. In this regard, strong absorption line systems such as damped Lyman systems and Lyman limit systems LLSs are particularly useful. The strong Lyman absorption systems are dense regions in high redshift galaxies, for which it is possible to use precision spectroscopy to measure the hydrogen and deuterium column densities, as illustrated in Fig. 6. At present, only handfuls of such measurements have been made, but these have been used to pre cisely determine e.g. arXiv 1710.11129 D H p 2 .527 0.030 10 5 where the p subscript indicates we are referring to the primordial value of this ratio. The mea sured value of this quantity doesn t show any correlation with redshift or metallicity a measure of past star formation , supporting the conclusion that these measurements re\ufb02ect the true primordial value. In contrast, measurements of the relative deuterium abundance in the Solar System and in the Milky Way show considerable variation, which is anti correlated with the presence of metals, indicative of the impact of stellar processing. Helium 4 This is a very strongly bound nucleus, so it is not destroyed by stellar processes, but is produced in stars together with other elements the observed abun dance should be larger than the primordial one. The primordial helium mass fraction, Yp,i sm o s te e c t i v e l yd e t e r m i n e dt h r o u g ht h em e a s u r e m e n t so fh e l i u ma n dh y d r o g e n emission lines from very low metallicity regions of partially ionized gas. These mea surements reveal a correlation between the4He abundance and the presence of metals in the system, indicating contamination of helium produced through fusion in stars. Extrapolating this relationship to zero metallicity results in a determination from arXiv 1112.3713 YP 0 .253 0.01 which compares well with the BBN prediction of around 0.248 for Planck baryon density parameters. Helium 3 Determinations of the primordial abundance of helium 3 have proven dif \ufb01cult. Measurements of3He have been made in the Solar System and the interstellar stellar medium, each indicating3H H 1.1 0.2 10 5.T h a t b e i n g s a i d ,3He is both destroyed and created in stars at relevant rates, making it unclear whether these mea surements are truly indicative of the primordial value. For this reason, most modern BBN analyses do not make use of any measurements of3He.

Such measurements have been used to determine Li H p 1 .6 0.3 10 10 Although this ratio represents the combined abundance of both 7Li and 6Li, the contribution from6Li is expected to be smaller than that of 7Li by a factor of 10 5.T h e o b s e r v e d r e l a t i o n s h i p b e t w e e n t h i s q u a n t i t y a n d s t e l l a r metallicity has raised questions about whether the lithium abundance might be de pleted in stars with moderate metallicities.

The other measurements then provide a highly non trivial consistency check on BBN predictions. They also constrain the number of additional light neutrinos or any other contribution to the energy densities at very high redshifts that would have changed the expansion rate during BBN. The value of that is observed, giving b 0.05, is broadly consistent with independent measurements at a redshift ofz 1100 from the anisotropies in the CMB. Once b or is \ufb01xed, we can then test observations of other abundances against the BBN predictions. These are broadly consistent for deuterium and helium 4. For lithium, observations suggest lithium is present at the order of magnitude predicted by BBN, but in detail signi\ufb01cantly less is observed than we d expect this is sometimes called the lithium problem see e.g. arXiv 1203.3551 .

The predicted abundances of light elements in BBN as a function of or equivalently B are plotted in Fig. 7 from a numerical code that evolves the full hierarchy of interaction equations . The fact that we \ufb01nd reasonably good quantitative agreement with observations is one of the great triumphs of the Big Bang model. 5.2 BBN Predctions and Testing the Standard Model The primordial abundances of light elements depends on the following parameters Neutron lifetime which is used to express the rate of the weak interactions. Nowa days, this is pretty well known. If n were larger, for example, then we would have a smaller interaction rate, which would imply a larger neutron freeze out temperature and larger neutron to proton ratio, and therefore a larger4He abundance. Baryon to photon ratio T h e m a s s f r a c t i o n f o r t h e n u c l e a r s p e c i e s i s p r o p o r t i o n a l to this parameter, so the smaller is, the smallerXA photon destruction of formed nuclei remains e ective until lower temperatures when there are more photons per baryon . A higher means that the mass fractions for the deuterium, tritium and3He build up earlier, so that the synthesis of4He is more e cient, we get more helium and less is left of the lighter nuclei. This number can be constrained both from comparison of BBN predictions with data, and also independently through the detailed shape of the spectrum of anisotropies in the CMB. E ective number of relativistic degrees of freedom o r e q u i v a l e n t l y , t h e t o t a l energy density at the time of BBN.

Therefore, the Universe will be younger at a given temperature, i.e. the pre factor in eqn. 53 would be smaller. This means that the time between the temperature when neutrinos freeze out and the temperatureTnuc when deuterium starts forming would be shorter, and there would thus be less time for neutrons to decay see e.g. eqn. 54 . The neutron to proton ratio is therefore larger at the on set of nucleosynthesis and so is the \ufb01nal primordial helium abundance. Observations constrain the extra number of neutrino families to be less than one. 20 Figure 6 Lyman series transitions for a Lyman Limit System atzabs 2 .504 towards the quasar Q1000 2956.

The structures observed today, such as galaxies and groups and clusters of galaxies are assumed to have grown from small initial density perturbations due to gravitational instability. In this scenario, structure formation in the Universe involves the following two aspects i the properties and origin of the initial density perturbations, and ii the time evolution of the cosmological perturbations in an expanding Universe. One of the great successes of the cold dark matter CDM cosmological model is that the same theory which perfectly describes the temperature anisotropies in the CMB in the re combination era just 400, 000 years after the Big Bang z 1100 , also precisely describes the clustering pattern of galaxies observed in the local universe z 0 , some 14 Gyr later.

In a nutshell, our goal for the next few lectures is to develop the mathematical formalism used to quantify these density \ufb02uctuations, learn how density \ufb02uc tuations evolve when the perturbations are small, and ultimately understand why the power spectrum of density \ufb02uctuations,P k , shown in the right panel of Fig. 1 has the shape that it does.

This appears obvious when we realize that from our standpoint on Earth, the exact initial conditions like the positions and velocities of matter on cosmological scales are unknowable. The situation is quite similar to that in statistical mechanics to describe the properties of a gas we do not seek to trace the positions and velocities of individual molecules but, instead, we are interested in the statistical properties given by some distribution functions. In cosmology the more fundamental limitation is that ultimately, the seeds of structure in the universe are quantum mechanical \ufb02uctuations during in\ufb02ation, and theory only allows us to predict the statistical properites of cosmological \ufb01elds like the matter overdensity . In this section we describe the basic statistical properties imposed upon such \ufb01elds under the assumption that the physics which generated the initial \ufb02uctuations, and subse quently processes them, respects the symmetries of the background cosmology, which is to say homogeneity and isotropy. In what follow we will denote expectation values with angle brackets, e.g.h i.Y o u c a n think of this as either a quantum mechanical expectation value or an average over some statistical ensemble of universes. While formally this ensemble of universes only exists in our minds, more practially we can imagine that these averages over the statistical ensemble are equivalent to averaging over representative volumes of the real universe. 1.1 Random Fields Consider a random \ufb01eld x i . e .a te a c hp o i n tx in space x i ss o m es t o c h a s t i cv a r i a b l e with zero meanh x i 0 . O f t e nw ew i l lf o c u so nt h eo v e r d e n s i t y\ufb01 e l d x ,b u t the formalism we are developing applies to any cosmological random \ufb01eld. The probability of realizing some \ufb01eld con\ufb01guration is afunctional P x , which is to say a function of af u n c t i o n x . We can make the mathematics less abstract if we imagine dividing the Universe into n in\ufb01nitesimal cells which are centered atx1, x2,. . . xn where they have values x1 , x2 , ... xn . The random perturbation \ufb01eld x i st h e nc h a r a c t e r i z e db y the probability distribution function P 1, 2,. . . , n d 1d 2...d n, 1 where now P is the function which gives the probability that the \ufb01eld has values in the range i to i d i at positions xi. Correlators of \ufb01elds are expectation values of products of \ufb01elds at di erent spatial locations and, generally, times , which we denote with angle brackets. The distributon functionP is completely determined if we know all of its moments h 1 1 2 2 ... n n i Z 1 1 2 2 ... n n P 1, 2,. . . , n d 1d 2...d n, 2 where the i are non negative integers. Since the cosmological principle requires all positions and directions in the Universe to 2 be equivalent, the cosmological density \ufb01eld must bestatistically homogeneous and isotropic. This implies that all moments are invariant under spatial translation and rota tion. For example, the \ufb01rst moment h x i 0 , 3 which follows directly from the de\ufb01nition of the density perturbation \ufb01eld. The second moment 2 h 2 x i, 4 must also be independent of x. Another imortant moment is the two point correlation function x h x1 x2 i, with x x1 x2 , 5 where by statistical homogeneity and isotropy, x m u s td e p e n do n l yo nt h ea m p l i t u d eo f the di erence x1 x2 . We will often \ufb01nd it useful to decompose the density peturbation into its constituent Fourier modes1 x Z d3k 2 3 k eik x and k Z d3x x e ik x. 6 Note that k i sac o m p l e xq u a n t i t ys ow ec a nw r i t e k A k iB k k ei k . 7 But since x i sar e a l\ufb01 e l d ,t h e n k k w h i c hi m p l i e sA k A k a n dB k B k . The statistical properties of k w o u l dt h u sa l s of u l l yd e s c r i b et h ep r o p e r t i e so f x . Speci\ufb01cally, we also have the distribution function P k1 , k2 ,. . . , kn d k1 d k2 ...d kn d k1 d k2 ...d kn , 8 which gives the probability that the modes ki have amplitudes in the range ki to ki d ki and phases in the range ki to d ki . We can similarly compute correlators ink space. For example, consider the two point cor relation of the Fourier transform of x between wavenumbersk and k0 h k k0 i Z d3x Z d3x0h x x0 ie ik xeik0 x0 . 9 But given statistical homogeneity and isotropy see eqn. 5 we can write h x x0 i x x0 . 10 1Note that there is no consensus on where to put the factors of 2 3 in these Fourier transforms. Some authors put the 2 3 in spatial integral, others adopt a symmetric convention with a factor of 2 3 2 in both integrals. This can be a signi\ufb01cant source of confusion. 3 Thus h k k0 i Z d3x Z d3x0 x x0 e ik xeik0 x0 , 11 and changing variables from fromx0 to z x0 x we get h k k0 i Z d3xe i k k0 x Z d3z z eik0 z. 12 Now using the de\ufb01ntion of the Dirac delta function D q 1 2 3 Z d3xe iq x, 13 we get h k k0 i 2 3 D k k0 P k , 14 where thepower spectrumis de\ufb01ned as P k Z d3x x e ik x. 15 The power spectrum is thus the Fourier transform of the 2 point correlation function, and vice versa. Because of statistical homogeneity and isotropy, x only depends on the norm of x,a n dt h er e l a t i o n s h i pb e t w e e nP k a n d x c a nb ef u r t h e rs i m p l i \ufb01 e dt o P k Z 1 0 x sin kx kx 4 x2dx, 16 so statistical homogeneity and isotropy also impliesP k o n l yd e p e n d so nt h en o r mo fk. We also have the inverse relation x 1 2 3 Z d3kP k eik x 1 2 3 Z 1 0 P k sin kx kx 4 k2dk 1 2 2 Z 1 0 P k sin kx kx k2dk. 17 We can evaluate the expression above at zero lag to gain some intuition about the power spectrum. At zero lag 0 is 0 h 2 x i 2, 18 just the variance of the \ufb01eld. Thus the equation above implies 2 1 2 2 Z 1 0 P k k2dk 1 2 2 Z 1 0 P k k3d ln k Z 1 0 2 k d ln k, 19 where in the last line we de\ufb01ned thedimensionless power spectrum 2 k k3 2 2 P k d 2 d ln k. 20 It is clear from eqn. 19 that the dimensionless power spectrum quanti\ufb01es the contribution 4 to the total variance of from each logarithmic wavenumber interval. It is thus a measure of the amount of density \ufb02uctuations coming from each spatial scale. 1.2 Gaussian Random Fields Ar a n d o m\ufb01 e l d x is said to be Gaussian if the distribution of the \ufb01eld values at an arbitrary set ofn points 1, 2,. . . , n , which we describe with ann dimensional row vector, 1, 2,. . . , n , is ann dimensional multivariate Gaussian P 1, 2,. . . , n P 1 2 n det 1 2 exp T 1 2 , 21 where the matrix has elements ij xi xj h i ji. 22 In particular, the one point distribution of the \ufb01eld itself is also Gaussian P 1 2 2 1 2 exp 2 2 2 , 23 where 2 0 h 2 x i. Any linear combination of Gaussian deviates will also have a Gaussian distribution. This allows us to obtain the distribution of k A k iB k , since from the Fourier transform, they are a linear combination of x , which is Gaussian distributed. As noted before, since x i sr e a l ,a n d k k , orA k A k a n dB k B k . This implies that we need only consider Fourier modes withk in the upper half space to fully specify x . Furthermore, because of statistical homogeneity and isotropy, the result is even simpler in k space, since the two point function h k k0 i 2 3 D k k0 P k , 24 or the covariance is diagonal. As a result the distribution functions ofA k a n dB k h a v e the simple form P k 1 V P k 1 2 exp 2 k P k V , 25 where k s t a n d sf o re i t h e rA k o rB k a n dV is the volume of the domain in question. We thus see that for a Gaussian random \ufb01eld, di erent Fourier modes are mutually inde pendent, and so are the real and imaginary parts of individual modes. This in turn implies that the phases k o fd i e r e n tm o d e sa r em u t u a l l yi n d e p e n d e n t ,a n dh a v ear a n d o md i s tribution over the interal 0 2 .I no t h e rw o r d s ,t h ef o r mo ft h ed i s t r i b u t i o na b o v ei m p l i e s that in terms of k and k we have Pk k , k d k d k e x p k 2 2VP k k d k VP k d k 2 . 26 5 Thus the Fourier amplitudes k follow the Rayleigh distribution, with uncorrelated ran dom phases. It follows that if we want to know the joint distribution of a set of Fourier modes ki ,i ti sj u s t P k1 , k2 ,. . . , kn nY i Pk ki , ki , 27 where Pk k , k is given by eqn. 26 . Because the two point function covariance is diagonal the probability distribution factorizes into a product of individual probability distributions, which is to say that we can treat k f o re a c hk mode as uncorrelated draws from independent random processes.

Figure from Coles arxiv e prints 0209590. Now that we have built up this statistical formalism, a few comments about Gaussian \ufb02uc tuations are in order The 2 point function speci\ufb01es everything.For Gaussian random \ufb01elds we only need to know the power spectrumP k , or equivalently the correlation function x , since they are Fourier transforms of each other. Whereas one generally needs all moments to fully specify a generic distribution see eqn. 2 it is intuitive that Gaussianity only requires the second moments, since by construction our \ufb01elds have zero meanh x i h k i 0 . M o r e generally, all correlators of odd numbers of points vanish h k i h k1 k2 k3 i ... 0 , 28 and all correlators of even numbers of points can be expressed in terms of the 2 point function. 6 o For example, the 4 point function h k1 k2 k3 k4 i h k1 k2 ih k3 k4 i h k1 k3 ih k2 k4 i h k1 k4 ih k2 k3 i 29 It is much easier to work ink space. When we solve the equations that govern how density perturbations x e v o l v e ,w ew i l l\ufb01 n dt h a ti nt h el i n e a rr e g i m e x 1, the principle of superposition implies that the Fourier modes k evolve independently implying that k,t D t k,t i 3 0 where ti is some early initial time at which we know the \ufb02uctuation spectrum. Thus the probability distribution of the Fourier modes will always be separable as in eqn. 27 and described by a power spectrum P k,t D2 t P k , 31 where P k i st h ep o w e rs p e c t r u ma tt h ei n i t i a lt i m eti.T h i s r e m a r k a b l e s i m p l i \ufb01 c a t i o n i s the result of two factors 1 statistical homogeneity and isotropy and Gaussianity guarantee separability in the initial conditions, and 2 linearity of the di erential equations guaranteeing that k modes continue to evolve independently i.e. the principal of superposition . Note that the situation is much more complicated in con\ufb01guration space, since eqn. 22 indicates that the covariance matrix, which is the two point correlation function, is not diagonal. Physically what this means is that the density contrast described by a Gaussian statistically isotropic and homogenous \ufb01eld is correlated across positions. Furthermore, linear structure formation via gravitational instability will further correlate the positions. Imagine if we setup our initial conditions such that the probability distribution in con\ufb01guration space in eqn. 21 could be factorized into a product ofn individual distributions, as is the case in k space see eqn. 27 , which would imply that the overdensity at every position in space x is independent of all the other locations. After a short amount of time, the gravitational in\ufb02uence of the particles on one another will destroy this mutual independence very quickly, resulting in correlated positions. Gaussianity is intimately related to linear evolution and random phases. Non linear evolution causes the Gaussian description to break down because themode mode coupling of distinct Fourier modes implies that eqns. 26 and 27 become invalid. This is intimately related to the generation of correlated phases. As we see from the distribution function in eqn. 26 , the phases of the Fourier modes k a r ed i s t r i b u t e du n i f o r m l yo nt h e interval 0 to 2 . Imagine that we initially have a spectrum of Gaussian primordial density \ufb02uctuations such that the initial phase distribution is uniform. When perturbations remain small evolution proceeds linearly, individual modes grow independently as described above, and the original random phase distribution is preserved. However, as perturbations grow large their evolution becomes non linear and Fourier modes of di erent wavenumber begin to couple together. This gives rise to phase association and consequently to non Gaussianity. The left panel of Fig. 2 shows a cosmological N body simulation of dark matter clustering 7 which has evolved to be signi\ufb01cantly non linear such that it exhibits the familiar cosmic web structure. Whereas in the right panel, all of the phases of the Fourier modes have been randomly reshu ed. Thus these two pictures have exactly the same power spectraP k , indeed they even have exactly the same realization of Fourier amplitudes k f o ra l lk.B u t the correlated phases at left, compared to the randomness of phases at right, give rise to a totally di erent clustering morphology. In\ufb02ation predicts Gaussian initial \ufb02uctuations.Since a Gaussian \ufb01eld remains Gaus sian during linear evolution, the generic prediction of in\ufb02ationary models is thus that x in the linear regime follows Gaussian statistics. To date, all observational tests of this hy pothesis have not yet revelaed any evidence for deviations from Gaussianity in the initial conditions, which explains why Gaussian random \ufb01elds are so important in cosmology. 1.3 The Correlation Function Consider the two point correlation function x h y x y i. 32 Now consider a volumeV that is large enough to contain many representative statistically homogenous and isotropic regions. We can imagine that each sub volume ofV represents a draw from the statistical properties of the universe, allowing us to replace the statistical ensemble average above with a volume average x 1 V Z d3y y x y . 33 Using this relation we can arrive at a di erent probabilistic interpretation of the correlation function x . Using the fact that this equation becomes x 1 2 Z d3y V y x y 1 2 Z d3y V y x y 1, 34 where the last equality used the fact that the volume integral of y i s .I f w e d e \ufb01 n e t h e new variablesu y x1 and x2 x1 x,w ec a nr e w r i t et h i se q u a t i o na s Z d3u V u x1 u x2 2 1 x1 x2 . 35 If x r e p r e s e n t st h es m o o t hd e n s i t yo fs o m ec l a s so fo b j e c t s l i k eg a l a x i e s t h e nt h e probability of \ufb01nding P12 two galaxies near each other with separation x1 x2 will be proportional to P12 Z d3u V u x1 u x2 2 1 x1 x2 . 36 If these two events were independent, i..e if the existence of galaxy atx1 has no e ect on the probability of \ufb01nding a galaxy atx2, then the same probabiblityPind 2. Hence the 8 ee excess probability over random occurence of \ufb01nding a pair of galaxies separated by x1 x2 is given by P12 Pind 1 x1 x2 . 37 The correlation function is therefore a direct measure of the excess probability over random of \ufb01nding two objects separated by x1 x2 . Alternatively stated, if we consider an in\ufb01nitesimal volume element dV1 centered on position x1,a n ddV2 centered on position x2,t h e nt h e probability of \ufb01nding a pair of objects with one object indV1 and the other indV2 is dP 2 1 x1 x2 dV1dV2. 38 1.4 Filtering and Mass Moments If x i saG a u s s i a nr a n d o m\ufb01 e l d ,a n yo t h e rl i n e a rf u n c t i o no f will also be Gaussian distributed. One such function is theexcess mass contained within a sphere of radiusR, centered at some pointx MR x Z y R x y d3y Z all y x y R y d3y, 39 where z is the Heaviside function which has z 1f o rz 0, and zero otherwise. We can generalize this de\ufb01nition and write MR x Z x y W y d3y, 40 where W y i sa \ufb01lter or window function which has the property thatW y 1f o r y R ,a n dW y 0f o r y R .S o m e t i m e so n ep r e f e r st ou s eaw i n d o wf u n c t i o nt h a ti s smoother than the top hat Heaviside window function we used above. One such example is the Gaussian W y e x p y2 2R2 . 41 Notice that the e ect of the window function is to average out the \ufb02uctuations in x a t scales smaller thanR. This is clearly seen in the Fourier transform of eqn. 40 MR k W k k 2 3 2R3 k e x p k2 2 1 R 2 , 42 where in the last equality we plugged in the Fourier transformW k f o rt h eG a u s s i a n\ufb01 l t e r function in eqn. 41 . Thus we see that our \ufb01lter is a low pass \ufb01lter the \ufb01lter function is very smallW k 1f o rh i g h k modes k R 1 i.e. for small wavelengths 2 k R , suppressing them in the \ufb01ltered \ufb01eld MR. Since x is a Gaussian random \ufb01eld, so is MR.W ew o u l dl i k et oc o m p u t et h ev a r i a n c ei n 9 the relative mass excess R x MR MR , 43 which can be computed exactly once we de\ufb01ne the mean massMR inside of our \ufb01lter.

With this in mind, we can instead renormalize our \ufb01lters such that their volume integral is unity top hat W x 8 3 4 R3 x R 0o t h e r w i s e W k 3 kR 3 sin kr kR cos kR Gaussian W x 1 2 3 2R3 exp x2 2R2 W k e x p k2R2 2 . 45 With these de\ufb01nitions, the Fourier transform of R x b e c o m e s R x Z d3k 2 3 k W k eik x, 46 and its variance can be written 2 R h 2 R x i Z 1 0 2 k W2 k d ln k. 47 As we will see, although there are compelling theoretical arguments for the shape of the power spectrum of primordial density \ufb02uctuations in the Universe, the amplitude of these density \ufb02uctuations is not something that can be predicted ab initio by in\ufb02ationary theory. Thus we have to resort to normalizing the power spectrum from observations. For historical reasons a common prescription for normalizing the linear theory power spectrum uses the variance of the relative mass excess, R x i ns p h e r e so fr a d i u sR.I ft h en u m b e ro fg a l a x i e s traces the mass, then this can be determined from the variance in the number of galaxies enclosed by randomly placed spheres with radiusR,w h i c hi ss e e nt od e p e n do nt h ep o w e r spectrum from eqn. 47 above. Indeed, the value of R d e r i v e df r o mt h ed i s t r i b u t i o n of galaxies is about unity forR 8 h 1 Mpc, where the strange h 1 units are a vestige of a time when the Hubble constant was poorly known2.T h e r e a r e s e v e r a l p r o b l e m s w i t h this approach, namely since R 1, one is not actually probing the linear regime where 1.

Although people no longer use the variance of galaxy counts to normalize the power spectrum, this convention of denoting the normalization of the linear theory power spectrum with 8 h 1 Mpc is still commonly used. 11 Phys 236 Cosmology Lecture 10 In\ufb02ation So far we have emphasized the successes of the standard Hot Big Bang model for the universe, but it turns out that it also has some serious problems. The standard Big Bang theory described in the previous lecutres is incomplete. Key features of the observed universe, such as its large scale homogeneity and \ufb02atness, seem to require that the Universe started with very special, \ufb01nely tuned initial conditions. These initial conditions must be imposed by hand. In this lecture, we will learn how in\ufb02ation an early period of accelerated expansion drives the primordial Universe towards this special state, even if it started from more generic initial conditions. 1 Problems with the Hot Big Bang Model 1.1 The Flatness Problem Recall the Friedmann equation H2 a 8 G 3 m0a 3 r0a 4 0 kc2 R2 0a2 , 1 We can rewrite this equation as 1 t k c H t R0a t 2 , 2 where t t crit t r m vac crit 3 and crit t 3H2 t 8 G . 4 Now to build intuition about the quantity 1 t , recall our semi classical derivation of the Friedmann equation. Speci\ufb01cally, we considered a small spherical region of \ufb01xed mass M enclosed within a radius R,a n da r g u e dt h a tat e s tm a s sa tR would experience an acceleration R GM R2 , 5 which we then integrated once \ufb01rst multiplying both sides by R t oo b t a i n 1 2 R2 GM R E 1 2 R2 4 G R2 3 E, 6 1 where E was a constant of integration that we argued is the energy per unit mass of our test particle. We then substitutedR a t R0 and identi\ufb01ed E kc2 2R2 0 and arrived at the Friedmann equation above. The three possible fates of this classical expanding sphere model of the universe are analogous to the three possible fates of a ball thrown upward from the surface of the Earth. If the ball is thrown upward with enough energy such that its speed is greater than the escape velocity it continues to in\ufb01nity. If thrown upward with less energy, it reaches a maximum altitude and then falls back down. Third and \ufb01nally, if the ball is thrown upward with exactly the right energy such that its speed equals the escape speed it reaches in\ufb01nity ast !1 . Continuing with this analogy, if we can evaluate 1 t a ta n yt i m e ,t h e nw ed e t e r m i n e this energy in the Friedmann equation, which is e ectively like determining the initial conditions for the expansion. Distinct from the classical treatment, GR states that this initial condition on the energy contents is intimately related with the geometry of spacetime, since it determinesk and R0.F o r t h e s a k e o f o u r c l a s s i c a l a n a l o g y , f o r t h e m o m e n t i g n o r e t h e impact of dark energy.

And if 1 the geometry is \ufb02at, and the universe has just enough energy contents to also expand forever ending in a Big Chill. Indeed, the 1 case is the analog of the ball thrown up atexactly the escape velocity. With this in mind, we can evaluate eqn. 2 at the present moment 1 0 k cH 1 0 R0 2 . 7 The current best constraints on 0 t t0 c o m ef r o mt h ec o m b i n i n gt h eP l a n c k CMB measurements with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements.

Why should the radius of curvature be so large today so as to give a value of 0 so close to unity? Indeed, following the discussion above, in GR the radius of curvatuve of the Universe R0 is determined by its mass energy contents, and so the closeness of 0 to unity amounts to some very \ufb01nely tuned initial condition, 0 r0 m0 vac0 1 . 10 But 0 could be any number like 106 or 10 6 without violating any law of physics.

The key point to note here is that the Friedmann equation indicates the curvature term is dy 2 namically unimportant at early times compared to matter and radiation, but becomes more relevant at late times because it dilutes more graduallya 2.T h i si m p l i e st h a tt h ed e v i a t i o n of t f r o mu n i t yh a sb e e ng r o w i n go v e rt h ee n t i r eh i s t o r yo ft h eu n i v e r s e se x p a n s i o n . For example, by combining eqns. 2 and 7 we obtain 1 t H2 0 1 0 H2 t a2 t . 11 When the universe was dominated by radiation and matter, at redshiftsz zm 0 .33 t 10 Gyr , the Hubble parameter was H2 a H2 0 r0a 4 m0a 3 , 12 and hence the quantity 1 t e v o l v e da s 1 t 1 0 a2 r0 m0a. 13 During the radiation dominated phase of the universe, 1 t r a2 t, 14 and during matter domination 1 t m a t2 3, 15 where the last proportionality arises becaues a t1 2 during radiation domination and a t2 3 during matter domination, respectively.

More generally we can write 1 aeq . 10 30 Einit TeV 2 18 One could argue that the Planck epoch is the natural initial time to extrapolate back to. 3 Plugging in numbers forEPl 1 016 TeV gives 1 aPl . 10 62. 19 Why should the initial energy contents conspire to be within one part in 1062 from the critical density? Indeed, our very existence depends on this seeming coincidence. If for example the deviation of from unity at the time of nucleosynthesis were instead one part in 106 instead of the one in 1016 above, the universe would have collapsed in a Big Crunch or expanded to al o w d e n s i t yB i gC h i l la f t e ro n l yaf e wd e c a d e s . Obviously this condition is satis\ufb01ed if the spatial curvature vanishes k 0 s i n c e 1 exactly in that case, but a mechanism is still required to set up such an initial state.

It would be far more satisfactory if we had a physical mechanism for \ufb02attening the universe early in its history, instead of relying on extremely \ufb01ne tuned initial conditions at the Planck time or distant past. In\ufb02ation provides this mechanism. 1.2 The Horizon Problem The CMB is observed to be the same temperature in all directions to a precision of one part in 105.T h i s f a c t e x p l a i n s w h y r e c o m b i n a t i o n a n d d e c o u p l i n g o c c u r a s a n a b r u p t p h a s e transition, which in turn explains why the surface of last scattering is a thin surface, because all of the di erent directions on the sky went through recombination and decoupling during the same narrow time interval. Should we be surprised that this event was so synchronized, and that the CMB is isotropic? Careful re\ufb02ection upon these facts points to an apparent paradox. Previously we learned about the the particle horizon, which is the largest comoving distance from which an observer at timet will be able to receive signals traveling at the speed of light rph t Z t 0 cdt a t . 20 The spacetime diagram in Fig. 1 shows our past light cone which intersects the surface of last scattering atz 1100, and the Big Bang singularity atz 1 or a 0 . C o n s i d e rt w o opposite directions on the sky. The CMB photons that we receive from these directions were emitted at the points labelledp and q in the \ufb01gure. The CMB that we observe coming from these two points re\ufb02ects the temperature of the universe atz 1100 and the anisotropies are sensitive to density and velocity \ufb02uctuations that existed at that time . We see that the photons were emitted su ciently close to the Big Bang singularity that the past light cones of p and q don t overlap. This implies that no point lies inside the particle horizons of both p and q. So the puzzle is how do the photons coming fromp and q know that they should be at almost exactly the same temperature? 4no canal contact Figure 1 Illustration of the horizon problem in the conventional Big Bang model. All events that we currently observe are on our past light cone. The intersection of our past light cone with the spacelike slice at the time of recombination is the surface of last scattering. Points that are separated by more than 2 on the sky seem never to have been in causal contact, since their past light cones don t overlap. Figure from Baumann. To understand how large the causally connected regions actually are, we will calculate the angular size of the particle horizon at the surface of last scattering. You did this calculation in the homework but let s go over it again. Recall that the particle horizon is a comoving distance, but we would like a proper distance so that we can compute an angular size. If 5 dhor is the proper distance we desire attls then dhor a tls rph tls a tls Z tls 0 cdt a t 0 .251 Mpc. 21 The angular diameter distance to the surface of last scattering isdA 1 2.8M p c t h i s s e e m s insanely small since we usually think of cosmological distances as being in Gpc, but recall that the angular diameter distance scales asdc z 1 z , and is not monotonic but rather peaks at z 1a n dt h e nd e c r e a s e s ,s ot h e nt h ea n g u l a rs i z ei s hor dhor tls dA tls 0.251 Mpc 12.8M p c 1.1 . 22 Thus any two points in the CMB that are separated by more than roughly 2 on the sky are basically causally disconnected. There are 40, 000 deg2 in 4 steradians, and so in fact the CMB is made up of about 104 di erent causally disconnected regions of space. The homogeneity of the CMB spans scales that are much larger than the particle horizon at the time when the CMB was formed. The only way to explain its isotropy is to postulate that these regions actually were somehow causally connected. In\ufb02ation also achieves this goal. 1.3 The Monopole Problem The electroweak theory by Weinberg, Salam, and Glashow successfully uni\ufb01es the electrog magnetic and weak forces at at 1 TeV. In particle physics, a Grand Uni\ufb01ed Theory GUT is a \ufb01eld theory that attempts to unify the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force. By extrapolating the known properties of the strong and electroweak forces to higher energies, particle physicists estimate that at an energy EGUT 1012TeV 10 4EPl TGUT 1028 K tGUT 10 36 s. 23 the strong and electroweak forces should be uni\ufb01ed as a single grand uni\ufb01ed force. The GUT energy is about about for orders of magnitude smaller than the Planck energy,EPl. In GUT theories local symmetry under some simple symmetry group is spontaneously broken around the GUT energy to the gauge symmetry of the Standard Model under the group SU 3 SU 2 U 1 . In all such cases, the scalar \ufb01elds that break the symmetry can be left in twisted con\ufb01gurations that carry non zero magnetic charge and that cannot be smoothed out through any continuous processes. Thus GUT theories predict that the GUT phase transition creates point like topological defects that act like magnetic monopoles. This poses a problem for comological models which is known as the Monopole Problem , because at the time of the GUT phase transition, points further apart than the horizon size at that time will be out of causal contact with each other, and thus one expects one topological defect per horizon volume. This would then predict a large number density of magnetic monopoloes in the present day universe which are not observed. You will explore the monopole problem 6 4 further on the homework. A phase of rapid expansion after the GUT phase transition would expand the volume of the universe and dramatically lower the number density of monopoles t h i si sh o wi n \ufb02 a t i o ns o l v e st h em o n o p o l ep r o b l e m . 2 The In\ufb02ation Solution In\ufb02ation can most generally be de\ufb01ned as the hypothesis that there was a period early in the history of our universe when the expansion was accelerating that is an epoch when a 0. Consider that at the relevant early times the energy density is dominated by a single energy component with equation of state P w c2, 24 we showed that the \ufb02uid equation 3 a a w 0 , 25 implies that a 3 1 w . 26 Plugging into the acceleration equation we \ufb01nd that a a 4 G 3 3P c2 4 G 3 1 3w . 27 Thus ifw 1 3 ! then a 0a n dt h ee x p a n s i o nw i l la c c e l e r a t e . We can see how this solves the horizon problem as follows. The particle horizon can be written rph t Z t ti cdt a Z a ai cda a a Z ln a ln ai c aH 1d ln a, 28 where ai 0c o r r e s p o n d st ot h eB i gB a n gs i n g u l a r i t y .T h i ss t a t e st h a tt h ec a u s a ls t r u c t u r e of the spacetime is related to the evolution of thecomoving Hubble radius, c aH 1. Assuming that the curvature term in the Friedmann equation is sub dominant compared to at the early times in question we have H2 8 G 3 aH 1 H 1 0 a1 2 1 3w , 29 where we have chosen to normalize this expansion rate to the present valueH0 or equiva lently we chose to normalize the total energy density of dark energy DE,0 at t t0 to be crit t0 3 H2 0 8 G . Carrying out the integral in eqn. 28 then gives rph a 2cH 1 0 1 3 w h a1 2 1 3w a 1 2 1 3w i i . 30 It is thus apparent that for a \ufb02uid which satis\ufb01es 1 3w 0o rw 1 3, then the comoving 7 \u02c7 particle horizon receives its largest contribution from late times, since for the second term limai!0 a 1 2 1 3w i 0 w 1 3 3 1 However, forw 1 3t h e nt h es e c o n dt e r md i v e r g e s limai!0 a 1 2 1 3w i 1 w 1 3 , rph a !1 . 32 Hence an equation of state for which the expansion is accelerating a 0d i r e c t l yi m p l i e s that the contributions to the particle horizon are dominated by the earliest times, and the result is that the particle horizon diverges toward the singularity atai 0 . B e c a u s et h e particle horizon now diverges as one approaches the Big Bang all points in the CMB have overlapping past light cones and therefore originated from a causally connected region of space. This behavior is illustrated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 In\ufb02ationary solution to the horizon problem. The spacelike singularity of the stan dard Big Bang is replaced by the reheating surface.

For concreteness let s consider the simplest implementation of in\ufb02ation with a univese that was dominated by something like a positive cosmological constant at early times i w 1 with energy density i implying that H2 i a 8 G 3 . 33 We worked out earlier that this form of energy admits solutions for which the scale factor grows exponentially with time a t eHit. 34 To explore the impact of this exponential growth, let s assume that that the universe had ap e r i o do fe x p o n e n t i a le x p a n s i o ns o m e t i m ei nt h em i d s to fi t se a r l yr a d i a t i o nd o m i n a t e d phase. For simplicity, imagine it switched on instantaneously at timeti,l a s t e du n t i ls o m e later time tf when it shuts o instantaneously, and after the exponential growth shuts o the universe transitions to a state of radiation dominated expansion again. For this simple case, we can write the scale factor as a t 8 ai t ti 1 2 t t i aieHi t ti ti t t f aieHi tf ti t tf 1 2 t t f . 35 Thus, between the timesti when in\ufb02ation began, and tf when it ended, the scale factor increased by a tf a ti eHi tf ti eN , 36 where N Hi tf ti . 37 We thus see that if the duration, tf ti , of in\ufb02ation was long compared to the age of the Universe at ti,w h i c hw a s H 1 i ,t h e nN is large and the growth of the scale factor was enormous. Let s consider one possible model where the exponential in\ufb02ation starts around the GUT scale when the energy isEGUT 1012 TeV which is when ti tGUT 10 36 s, 38 implying Hi t 1 GUT 1036 s 1 39 where we have used the scaling betweenE T a 1 t 1 2 for a radiation dominated universe to derivetGUT. After theseNe foldings the timetf is then tf N Hi ti N 1 tGUT 40 9 We can now see how in\ufb02ation resolves the \ufb02atness problem. Recall our equation for 1 t 1 t c H t R0a t 2 , 41 for any universe that is not perfectly \ufb02at k 0 . D u r i n gt h ee x p o n e n t i a le x p a n s i o no ft h e in\ufb02ationary epoch H t Hi c o n s ta n da t exp Hit i m p l y i n g 1 t e 2Hit, 42 so that the deviation between t a n du n i t yp l u m m e t se x p o n e n t i a l l yw i t ht i m e . I fw e compare 1 t at the beginning of exponential in\ufb02ation at timet ti with its value at the end of in\ufb02ation at timet tf N 1 ti, we \ufb01nd 1 tf 1 ti e 2Hi tf ti e 2N . 43 Imagine that prior to in\ufb02ation the Universe was actually strongly curved 1 ti 1. 44 After N e foldings of in\ufb02ation, the deviation of from unity would be 1 tf e 2N . 45 During the subsequent radiation dominated and matter dominated eras, the quantity 1 would increase again see eqn. 13 . But starting from the fact that today 1 0 0.002, 46 we can use the equation 1 t H2 0 1 0 H2 t a2 t 47 to extrapolate back in time and determine how much inlation was needed to \ufb02atten the universe to be consistent with observed constraints. If we approximate the universe as radiation dominated between the present epoch andtf then at tf N 1 tGUT N 1 10 36 s 4 8 the scale factor was a tf 2 10 28p N 1 , 49 where we used the expression derived in lecture4 for a radiation dominated Universe a t t t0 1 2 , 50 where t0 2 .4 1019 s 7 5 0 G y r . S of r o me q n . 1 3 t h ed e v i a t i o no f f r o mu n i t ya ttf 10 must have been 1 tf 1 0 a2 tf r0 m0a tf 1 0 a2 tf r0 , 51 Plugging in numbers we obtain 1 tf 10 54 N 1 . 52 If we equate this to our previous expression for the amount of \ufb02attening produced at the end of in\ufb02ation 1 tf e 2N , 53 we obtain e 2N 10 54 N 1 N ln 10 54 2 62. 54 Thus the minimum number of e foldings required to match the observation isN 62 which corresponds to an increase in the scale factor of a tf a ti e62 1027. 55 Note thatN may have actually been much greater than 62 since the constraint that we used for 1 0 was an upper limit on the deviation from observations, and the Universe could actually be much \ufb02atter than this. We saw in eqn. 32 that accelerating expansionw 1 3c a u s e st h ep a r t i c l eh o r i z o nt o diverge as the Big Bang singularity is approached. This increase of the particle horizon has the desired e ect of putting antipodal points on the CMB into causal contact as illustrated in Fig. 2 . For a model withN 65 e foldings the particle horizon at the epoch of last scattering dhor tls 200 Mpc 56 which is 800 times larger than the horizon sizedhor tls 0.25 Mpc that we calculated in the absence of in\ufb02ation, and guarantees that antipodal points on the last scattering surface are causally connected. 2.2 Scalar Fields As a simple toy model for in\ufb02ation we consider a scalar \ufb01eld t, x . As indicated by the notation, the value of the \ufb01eld can depend on timet and the position in space x. Associated with each \ufb01eld value is a potential energy densityV see Fig. 3 . If the \ufb01eld is dynamical i.e. changes with time then it also carries kinetic energy density. In some early imple mentations of in\ufb02ation this scalar \ufb01eld is associated with the Higgs \ufb01eld, which mediates interactions between particles at energies higher than the GUT energy, but we will keep the discussion general and just refer to the scalr \ufb01eld as thein\ufb02aton \ufb01eld,w h i c hh a su n i t so f energy. If the stress energy associated with the scalar \ufb01eld dominates the universe, it sources the evolution of the FRW background. We want to determine under which conditions this can lead to accelerated expansion. 11 Figure 3 Example of a slow roll potential. In\ufb02ation occurs in the shaded parts of the potential. Figure from Baumann. In quantum \ufb01eld theory one derives the stress energy of a general scalar \ufb01eld via Noether s theorem and the principle of least action T\u00b5 \u00b5 g\u00b5 1 2g V . 57 Consistency with the symmetries of the FRW spacetime requires that the in\ufb02aton only depends on time but not on spatial location1 t . From the time time component of the stress energy tensorT0 0 , we infer that the energy density kinetic z 1 2 2 c3 V z potential . 58 is a sum of the kinetic and potential energy densities. From the space space component Ti j P i j,w e\ufb01 n dt h a tt h ep r e s s u r ei st h edi erence of kinetic and potential energy 1Here we mean the background value of the in\ufb02aton, similar to the background matter density or radiation density, which recall is an average over some large scale. In other words, we are not considering the possibility of \ufb02uctuations in the in\ufb02aton. 12 densities, P 1 2 2 c3 V . 59 Right away we see that if the in\ufb02aton \ufb01eld changes only very slowly as a function of time 2 c3V , 60 then the potential energy dominates over the kinetic energy and the in\ufb02aton \ufb01eld behaves like a cosmological constant P V . 61 Recalling the Friedmann equation H2 a 8 G 3c2 a t eHi t ti , 62 where Hi p 8 G 3c2 and we have assumed that the in\ufb02aton \ufb01eld energy dominates over curvature. Thus the scalar \ufb01eld energy can drive exponential in\ufb02ation if there is a temporary period when its rate of change is small, and its potential energy large enough to dominate the energy density of the universe. Next we determine under what set of circumstances the conditions for in\ufb02ation 2 c3V are met in the early universe. Writing the \ufb02uid equation for the energy density of the in\ufb02aton \ufb01eld, 3 H t P 0 6 3 and combining with the expressions for and P above we arrive at a simple equation for the time evolution of the in\ufb02aton \ufb01eld 3 H t c3 dV d , 64 which is known as the Klein Gordon equation. Note that the Klein Gordon equation mimics the equation of motion of a particle with displacement accelerated by a force proportional to the gradient of the in\ufb02aton potential dV d ,b u ts u b j e c t e dt oaf r i c t i o n a lf o r c e3H which is proportional to the particles speed .T h u s , t h e e x p a n s i o n o f t h e u n i v e r s e r e s u l t s i nHubble dragwhich slows the transition of the in\ufb02aton \ufb01eld to a value that will minimize its potentialV . This implies that the in\ufb02aton \ufb01eld can reach aterminal velocity, where Hubble drag balances the force from the potential and thus 0 ,w h i c hi sw h e n 3H c3 dV d c3 3H dV d 65 13 \u02c7 If the in\ufb02aton is moving at this terminal velocity, then the condition that 2 c3V dV d 2 9H2V c3 , 66 which is a condition on the steepness of the in\ufb02aton potential. We can eliminate the Hubble constant by noting that H2 8 G 3c2 2 c3 V 8 G 3c2 V , 67 giving dV d 2 24 GV 2 c5 . 68 Note that MPl r c 8 G 2 .4 1015 TeV c2 , 69 is the Planck mass, so if we de\ufb01ne a Planck energy as EPl 1p 3MPlc2, 70 then the equation above \ufb01nally becomes EPl V dV d 2 1. 71 If the slope of the in\ufb02aton potential is su ciently shallow such that it satis\ufb01es the equation above, and if the amplitude of the potentialV is su ciently large to dominate the en ergy density of the universe, then the in\ufb02aton \ufb01eld is capable of giving rise to exponential expansion. A potential with this form is known as a slow roll potential which is illustrated in Fig. 3. The in\ufb02aton slowly rolls down the shallow potential towards its true minimum energy, and the time spent on this plateau sources the accelerating expansion of the universe forNe foldings of the scale factor causing the universe to grow by a tremendous amount. 14 Phys 236 Cosmology Lecture 12 13 Linear Structure Formation Now that we have established how to statistically describe density \ufb02uctuations in the universe we will study how some initial set of \ufb02uctuations grow and evolve with time because of grav itational instability. In its full generality this is a very complex and technical task. There are several reasons for this complexity. First, the di erential equations that describe structure formation are non linear which means that they will not admit simple analytical solutions, and furthermore the systems evolve chaotically. The remedy for this is straighforward one can always resort to numerical calulations. Non linear evolution is however unfortunately not the only complication. To fully solve for the evolution of structure Newtonian gravity will not su ce, and one needs to use the full machinery of general relativity. There are several reasons for this. The \ufb01rst is that, as we learned beore, all forms of mass energy can gravitate, and so to properly treat \ufb02uctuations in the relativistic components we need GR. Even more subtle and complicated are issues related to causality and the presence of horizons, which clearly requires GR since Newtonian gravity would imply action at a distance. Although Newtonian analysis provides valuable insight into the behavior of inhomogeneities, it su ers from the following di culty. As we will learn, at su ciently early epochs the wavelengths of density \ufb02uctuation modes that we will need to consider will lie outside of the particle horizonrph. Newtonian analysis is only valid for later times when the wavelengths of the \ufb02uctuations are much smaller than the particle horizon rph.T h u s t h e e a r l y e v o l u t i o n o fany mode needs to be tackled using the full machinery in GR. One of the main challenges with studying the growth of inhomogenities in GR is the question of gauge freedom. Qualitatively, you can think of the choice of a gauge as choosing a coordinate system. For modes much smaller than the horizon, there exists a natural choice of coordinates in which GR looks like Newtonian gravity, adhering to our physical intuition. However, for super horizon modes this is not the case, and for technical reasons one cannot work in this quasi Newtonian gauge. These gauge coordinate ambiguities make the full treatment in GR a rather daunting task. The full GR treatment is thus beyond the scope of this course. In this set of lectures we will restrict attention to the Newtonian treatment in the linear regime x 1, which allows us to linearize the di erential equations, allowing us to obtain analytical results in a few cases. In a future lecture, we will discuss evolution of density \ufb02uctuations in the non linear regime. 1 Jeans Instability Before treating an expanding universe, let s start by building our intuition by studying the growth of preturbations due to gravitational instability in a static nonexpanding uni verse. Thus we consider a homogenous isotropic background density of matter with time 1 independent density 0 r,t c o n s t. The evolution equations for a perfect \ufb02uid are t r v 0 c o n t i n u i t y 1 v t v r v rP r E u l e r 2 r2 4 G Poisson . 3 These equations express conservation of mass energy continuity , conservation of momen tum Euler , and gravity Poisson , respectively. They amount to \ufb01ve equations in six unknowns , v, P, , so they must be supplemented by another equation. Similar to our derivation of the Friedmann equation, we must supplement these equations with an equation of stateP P . Actually the most general form would be to assumeP P , S , where S is the entropy, but we will assume the entropy is \ufb01xed, S 0 ,w h i c hi st os a yw ew i l l only consider isentropic perturbations1 . We consider small perturbations about a homogenous solution r,t 0 r,t P r,t P0 P r,t v r,t v0 v v r,t r,t 0 r,t , 4 where the terms with zero subscript are constants, we have assumedv0 0, and 0, etc. Using the equation of state, the pressure perturbation can be written P c2 s , c 2 s P S 5 where cs is the sound speed. Note that as constructed this set of equations has some serious problems. If the \ufb02uid is to remain homogenous with constant density then we must also haveF r 0 0 ,o re l s e there would be a net gravitational force. But this implies thatr2 0 4 G 0 0a sw e l l ,s o the gas is not actually there! This means that there can be no homogenous self gravitating \ufb02uid in equilibrium. For now we will simply ignore this complication and assume that such as o l u t i o nw i t hr2 0 4 G 0 does exist, since it turns out to give a useful physical picture anyway. This is what is commonly referred to as theJeans swindle. Substituting eqns. 4 into the continuity equation eqn. 1 and gathering terms that are 1Entropy perturbations can occur only in multi component \ufb02uids. For example, in a \ufb02uid consisting of baryons and radiation, the baryons can be distributed inhomogeneously on a homogeneous background of radiation. In such a case, the entropy, which is equal to the number of photons per baryon, varies from place to place. In general there are two types of perturbations isentropic perturbations for which S 0 and 6 0 , and so called isocurvature pertubrations, which have 0 S 6 0 . 2 zeroth, \ufb01rst, and second order in products of perturbed quantities gives 0 t r 0v0 z 0th order t r 0 v r v0 z 1st order r v z 2nd order . 6 Here the 0th order terms concern the homogenous unperturbed universe. In this static case they are trivially zero, since we have assumed a constant background, but in the future when we perturb about an expanding homogeneous and isotropic background they will be satis\ufb01ed by the unperturbed zero subscript terms. Keeping only linear order in perurbed quantities, that is, ignoring the second order terms, we obtain for the perturbed continuity equation t 0r v, 7 where we used the fact thatv0 0. Applying this same procedure to all of the \ufb02uid equations in eqns. 1 3 gives t 0r v, continuity 8 v t c2 s 0 r r E u l e r 9 r2 4 G .

Noting that the coe cients in the equation above are constants which do not depend on position, we can thus express in terms of its Fourier transform r,t Z d3k 2 3 k,t eik r, 13 and plug into eqn. 11 to obtain a set of ordinary di erential equations for the time dependent Fourier coe cients k,t k,t k2c2 s 4 G 0 k,t 0 , 14 3 where dot denotes a time derivative with respect to timet,a n dk k . The equation above has two independent solutions k,t exp i! k t , 15 where ! k p k2c2 s 4 G 0. 16 The behavior of these isentropic perturbations depends crucially on the sign of the expression under the square root.

It thus characterizes the maximum distance over which sound waves can communicate, allowing pressure forces to counteract changes in the density due to gravitational instability. For \ufb02uctuations larger than this maximum distance J k k J , pressure cannot react quickly enough and the mode is unstable to gravitational collapse. For shorter wavelengths, J k k J pressure can react, and a pressure gradient is created which then counteracts collapse and instead gives rise to acoustic oscillations.

In an expanding homogenous and isotropic universe, the background energy density is a function of time, and the background velocities obey the Hubble law. At the beginning of the course we derived the Friedmann equations from Newtonian mechanics by considering a uniform expanding ball of \ufb02uid. Here we repeat this analysis but now from the perspective of the \ufb02uid equations. Without perturbations we have 0 t a n d v v0 H t r. 22 Plugging these into the continuity equation t r v 0 0 t t r 0 t H t r 0 t t 3 0 t H t 0 . 23 This just states that the total mass energy of non relativistic matter is conserved. This is equivalent to the energy equation we derived for an FRW universe 3 H P c2 0 , for the case ofP c2, i.e. in the Newtonian limit of a non relativistic \ufb02uid. Now consider the Poisson equationr2 4 G .T a k i n g 0 a tr 0 ,t h eP o i s s o n equation integrates as r r2 r 4 G 0 r2 24 r 1 3 4 G 0 r 25 1 6 4 G 0 r2 26 The Euler equation becomes v t v r v rP r 2 7 t H t r H t r r H t r rP 0 r 2 8 Hr H2 r r r z r 4 G 0 3 r 29 H H2 4 G 0 3 , 30 5 \u02cb where we used eqn. 25 above forr and assumed rP 0 ,s i n c eP P a n dw ea r e assuming a homogenous universe with 0 t s ot h e r et h e r ea r en op r e s s u r eg r a d i e n t s . But note that H d dt a a a a H2 H H2 a a, 31 but recalling the acceleration equation a a 4 G 3 3P c2 3 2 we see that the acceleration equation implies H H2 4 G 3 3P c2 . 33 Thus comparing the equation above, derived from the acceleration equation, to the result of applying the Euler equation to the background model in eqn. 30 , we see that they are equivalent if 3 P c2 ,o r P c2, which is again true in the Newtonian limit of an o n r e l a t i v i s t i c\ufb02 u i d .

For this reason it is more convenient to work with so called Lagrangian coordinatesx which 6 are comoving with the Hubble \ufb02ow,w h i c ha r er e l a t e dt ot h eE u l e r i a nc o o r d i n a t e sv i a r a t x, 39 where a t is the scale factor. However, with this new choice of coordinates we have to work out how the derivatives in the equations above transform. For example, the partial derivative with respect to time taken at constantr is di erent from the partial derivative with respect to time taken at constantx.C o n s i d e r a g e n e r a l f u n c t i o nf r,t , which we want to express at f r a t x,t . We can write df f t x dt f x t dx f t r dt f r t dr. 40 But note that dr x adt a t dx v0dt a t dx, 41 where the last equality used v0 dr dt ax H t r. 42 Thus our equation fordf above becomes df f t x dt f x t dx f t r dt f r t v0dt a t dx f t r v0 f r t dt a t f r t dx. 43 Thus gathering terms we conclude t r t x v0 r r 4 4 rr 1 arx. 45 Replacing the derviatives in eqns. 38 and introducing the fractional amplitude of the density pertubrations 0, we \ufb01nally obtain t 1 ar v 0 C o n t i n u i t y 4 6 v t H v c2 s a r 1 ar 0 E u l e r 4 7 r2 4 Ga2 0 Poisson , 48 where nowr r x, r2 r 2 x are all derivatives with respect to the Lagrangian coordinates x,a n dt h et i m ep a r t i a ld e r i v a t i v e sa r et a k e na tc o n s t a n tx.I n d e r i v i n g t h e e q u a t i o n s a b o v e , we used thatrr v0 3 H and v r r v0 H v. Finally, we can take the divergence of the Euler eqn. 47 and using the continuity and Poisson equations to expressr v and r2 in terms of ,w ed e r i v et h ec l o s e df o r me q u a t i o nw h i c hd e s c r i b e sg r a v i t a t i o n a li n s t a b i l i t yi n 7 an expanding universe 2 H c2 s a2 r2 4 G 0 0 . 49 Let s brie\ufb02y discuss the terms that appear in this equation 2 H z Hubble Drag 4 G 0 z gravity c2 s a2 r2 z pressure . 50 The right hand side has two source terms which are familiar from our study of Jeans in stability in a static universe, namely a gravitational term which promotes collapse, and a pressure term which opposes collapse. There is however now a newHubble Drag term which encodes the fact that the expansion of the universe acts like a friction term opposing the acceleration of gravitational instability. 2.3 Solution for an Einstein De Sitter Universe We observe that now in Lagrangian or comoving coordinates, the terms in eqn. 49 have coe cients which are independent of the spatial coordinatesx,a l l o w i n gu st op e r f o r ma Fourier decomposition of the overdensity \ufb01eld x x,t Z d3k 2 3 k,t eik x. 51 Plugging this expression into eqn. 49 and notingr! ik,w eo b t a i na no r d i n a r yd i e r e n t i a l equation for each independent Fourier mode k 2 H k k 4 G 0 c2 sk2 a2 , 52 where we have abbreviated k,t w i t h k. Note that since we are working in comoving coordinates x,t h ew a v e n u m b e r sk in eqn. 51 and the equation above are all comoving wavenumbers which correspond to \ufb02uctuations with wavelength 2 k which is also a comoving wavelength. If we consider the limitH 0a n da t 1 ,i . e . as t a t i cu n i v e r s e ,w er e c o v e re q n . 1 4 t h a t we derived in 1 for a static homogenous universe k k c2 sk2 4 G 0 0 . 53 The di erence now is that we are dealing with comoving wavenumbersk,a n dt h a tt h e r e is an extra Hubble drag term 2H k that slows down the growth relative to the static case which we will discuss momentarily. Based on what we learned in the static universe, we know that the behavior of a perturbation depends crucially on its spatial size, where the critical lengthscale which separates acoustic oscillations from gravitational instability is the 8 Jeans scale J 2 a kJ cs G 0 1 2 . 54 Note that the Jeans scale here is a proper wavelength, which explains the presence of the scale factor in eqn. 54 above, which converts the comoving wavelength com J 2 kJ to a proper wavelength via J a com J . Consider a \ufb02at, matter dominated universe, also known as an Einstein de Sitter Universe. The Friedmann equation states H2 t 8 G 3 0 t , 55 and since a 3 we saw previously that a t2 3 H 2 3t 0 t 1 6 Gt2 , 56 which implies J p 6 cst cst, 57 that is, the Jeans length is comparable to the sound horizon , which is the proper distance that a sound wave can travel over the age of the Universe. Thus analgous to the static case we \ufb01nd that the Jeans scale can be thought of as the sound communication time or the distance that a sound wave can travel in a gravitaional free fall time which is also equal to the expansion timeH 1 in an expanding universe. Perturbations on scales much smaller than the Jeans scale J a r eo s c i l l a t o r ya c o u s t i c waves, whereas on scales much larger than the Jeans scale J , gravity will dominate leading to collapse. But now owing to the expansion of the Universe, J changes with time so ag i v e np e r t u r b a t i o nm a ys w i t c hb e t w e e np e r i o d so fg r o w t ha n ds t a s i s a c o u s t i co s c i l l a t i o n s . We will see that these e ects govern the perturbation spectrum that has propagated into the present universe from early times. We will return to acoustic oscillations shortly, for the moment let us focus on scales J or k kJ such that we can igore thec2 sk2 a2 relative to the gravitational driving term 4 G 0 in eqn. 52 . For a \ufb02at matter dominated universe, using the expressions in eqn. 56 forH t a n d 0 t e q n . 5 2 s i m p l i \ufb01 e st o 2 H 4 G 0 c2 sk2 a2 4 G 0 58 4 3t 2 3t2 0 , where for simplicity we write to mean k.I fw eg u e s st h a tt h es o l u t i o n sh a v eap o w e rl a w form Dtn, 59 9 plugging this guess into the equation above yields n n 1 Dtn 2 4 3tnDtn 1 2 3t2 Dtn 0 n n 1 4 3n 2 3 0 . 60 The two possible solutions to the quadratic equation above aren 1a n dn 2 3. Thus the general solution for the time evolution of large scale J density perturbtations in a \ufb02at matter dominated universe is D1t2 3 D2t 1, 61 wwhere the values of D1 and D2 are determined by the initial conditions for t . The decaying mode t 1 eventually becomes negligilbly small compared to the growing mode t2 3.T h u s w e s e e t h a t o n c e t h e g r o w i n g m o d e d o m i n a t e s , t h e d e n s i t y o f p e r t u r b a t i o n s grows at the rate t2 3 a t 1 1 z, 62 provided the linear approximation 1h o l d s . I nt h ei m p o r t a n tc a s eo fa\ufb02 a t ,m a t t e r dominated universe, which is a good description of the universe at early times before takes over, the growing mode is proportional to the scale factor. Hence, we see that in an expanding universe, gravitational instability is much less e cient. Whereas in the static universe \ufb02uctuations grow exponentially on the gravitational free fall timescale, we see here that instead the perturbation amplitude increases only as a power of time. 2.4 Comparison to the CMB Anisotropy Level CMB anisotropy measurements probe temperature \ufb02uctuations which result from \ufb02uctua tions in the radiation energy density r T4,t h u s r r 4 T T . 63 Planck measured the rms temperature \ufb02uctuation to be T T 2 1 2 10 5 r r 10 5 b 10 5 64 where in the last equality we have assumed that \ufb02uctuations in the baryons must be compa rable to the radiation, since the baryons are tightly coupled to the radiation by Thompson scattering prior to decoupling. We just learned that in a matter dominated universe, which is a good description of the universe prior to very recently i.e. prior tozm 0.3 , that \ufb02uctuations larger than the Jeans scale J grow proportional to the scale factor, thus we expect b t0 a t0 a tdec b tdec 1 zdec b tdec 1100 10 5 10 2. 65 10 But we observe highly nonlinear structures in the universe today, and speci\ufb01cally we know that even on relatively large comoving scales of 8h 1 Mpc, approaching the smallest scales probed by the CMB R 8 h 1 Mpc 1, 66 which is a factor of one hundred larger than our estimate above. Where did we go wrong? Well there are a couple of important complications that we have ignored 1. Nature of the perturbed component. The universe is made up of collisionless dark matter cold, warm, hot? , baryons, and radiation. Our estimate above for the \ufb02uctuations from the CMB was based on using the CMB as a proxy for the baryonic component. The \ufb02uctuations in the underlying dark matter were much larger than 10 5 at decoupling explaining how we get large R 8 h 1 Mpc 1t o d a y . T h i si s actually one of the strongest pieces of evidence for dark matter. 2. Species which dominates the energy densityThe expansion of the universe pow ers the Hubble drag term in eqn. 50, which opposes gravitational instability. We saw that in the the matter dominated case expansion reduces the perturbation growth rate from exponential static universe to power law expanding universe . We thus expect that if other energy components radiation, dark energy dominate the expansion rate relative to the component experiencing gravitational collapse matter , that the growth of perturbations will slow down. 3 Coupled Perturbations If the energy density is comprised of a sum of contributions from di erent components X i i, 67 where e.g. i baryons, dark matter, photons, neturinos, etc., then the equation describing the evolution of the perturbation i in the non relativistic componenti is i 2 H i c2 sik2 a2 i 4 G h X j j j z non relativistic X k 2 k k z relativistic i . 68 Whereas the relativistic component obeys a slightly di erent equation i 2 H i c2k2 3a2 i 4 G hX j 4 3 j j z non relativistic X k 8 3 k k z relativistic i . 69 These modi\ufb01cations can be derived using special relativistic \ufb02uid mechanics and Newtownian gravity. The sound speed for a relativistic \ufb02uid iscs c p 3f o l l o w sf r o mt h ef a c tt h a t 11 P c2 3, which explains the pressure term for the relativistic component.

Radiation matter equality occurs prior to decoupling, and the baryons and the photons will be tightly coupled together in a photon baryon \ufb02uid with a sound speed that is very close to the speed of light, whereas the dark matter is an independent collisionless matter component which only interacts with the photon baryon \ufb02uid gravitationally. The main point to note is that the \ufb02uctuations in this photon baryon \ufb02uid should be very small inside of the particle horizon, in other words, according to eqn. 69 , for scales below J cH 1. Sub Jeans radiation \ufb02uctuations therefore oscillate as sound waves and their time averaged density contrast vanishes. To describe these \ufb02uctuations on the horizon scale properly GR is actually required. As such, typically when using the Newtonian equations above, one restricts attention to scales well within the horizon cH 1. This means we can can assume the relativistic components have zero \ufb02uctuations i 0. In this limit the equation describing the CDM \ufb02uctuations c becomes c 2 H c 4 G c c, 70 where thec2 sk2 a2 term now vanishes because CDM is a collisionless matter component which does not experience pressure forces i.e.cs 0 . T h i se q u a t i o ni si d e n t i c a lt oe q n . 5 8 e x c e p t that now we are not matter dominated. When the universe is radiation dominated H 1 2t H2 8 G 3 r c 8 G r 3 , 71 where in the last equality we assumed r c since we are radiation dominated. Note also that the \ufb01rst two terms in eqn. 70 c 2H c H2 c 72 since the only timescale in the problem is the Hubble time if pressure forces were relevant the other relevant timescale would be the sound crossing time cs,b u tw eh a v ea s s u m e d collisionless dark matter . But since 4 G c 4 G r H2, 73 we can neglect the term on the right hand side of eqn. 70 relative to the other two terms. In other words c 1 t c 0., 74 The solution to this equation is c t c ti 1 A ln t ti , 75 12 thus only a solution with an initial velocity , ti 6 0 ,c a na c t u a l l yg r o w s ot h a tA 6 0 , and only logarithmically at that. This suppression of the growth of \ufb02uctuations on scales inside the photon baryon \ufb02uid sound horizon during radiation domination is known as the Meszaros e ect. It says that, at early times, the dominant energy of radiation drives the universe to expand so fast that the collisionless matter, whose gravity is sub dominant, has no time to respond, and grows at most only logarithmically. At late times, the radiation eventually becomes negligible, and the growth of perturbations increases smoothly to the Einstein de Sitter a t behavior that we derived earlier. 3.2 Late Time Suppression of Structure Formation by Analogous to the Meszaros e ect is a similar suppression of perurbation growth at late times when the Universe becomes cosmological constant dominated. Indeed, this is more relevant to the future since we showed that the epoch of matter equality iszm 0.3. In this limit the equation governing CDM perturbations is c 2 H c 0, 76 where the Hubble parameter has the constant valueH H and we have assumed that we are dark energy dominated 4 G c 4 G H2 . 77 This equation has solutions of the form c t C1 C2e 2H t, 78 thus we see that suppresses the growth of structure. There is only a decaying mode, and a constant mode, but not a growing mode. As such, the \ufb02uctuations in the matter density reach a constant fractional amplitude. We have thus seen how linear perturbations grow when the universe is Einstein De Sitter and dominated. In general, we write the growing mode solution as c t D a , 79 where D a i st h el i n e a rg r o w t hf u n c t i o n ,w h i c hh a st ob es o l v e df o rn u m e r i c a l l y . 3.3 Baryons and DM Before and After Decoupling Now let s consider this same mix of photons, baryons, and CDM butafter matter radiation equality when the Universe is matter dominated. But now let s consider the \ufb02uctuations in the photon baryon \ufb02uid. The equations governing these coupled perturbations are c 2 H c 4 G c c b b 4 G c c 80 b 2 H b c2 sk2 a2 4 G c c b b c2 sk2 a2 4 G c c, 81 13 where in the last equality we have assumed that the dark matter dominates the matter content. Since the dark matter dominates the gravity and the expansion rate, and we are Einstein de Sitter and matter dominated, eqn. 80 for the dark matter yields the growing solution a t w h i c hw es t u d i e db e f o r e . T h u st h e4 G c c in the baryon evolution equation can be thought of as an external driving term. Given the pressure term in the evolution equation for the baryons and the fact that the Jeans scale J csH 1 cH 1 is comparable to the horizon size, nearly all modes inside the horizon havek kJ J . Thus the high sound speed causes the baryons to evolve di erently than the dark matter, namely the baryons will experience slowly declining sound waves b 1 acs 1 2 exp ik Z csdt a t . 82 These are the acoustic oscillations that give rise to the peaks in the CMB and the baryon acoustic oscillation signature in the dark matter power spectrum via the small back reaction of the baryons on the dark matter, which we have above ignored . Since some of these are large scale horizon size modes, and since the baryons and photons are tightly coupled into a single \ufb02uid, typically one resorts to GR to solve this problem correctly. Now let s examine what happens after decoupling. As you will show in the homework, the sound speed of the baryons drops precipitously, and now the Jeans scale of the baryons is extremely small, about comparable to the mass of a globular cluster. We can thus now consider the coupled perturbations, but ignore the pressure term c 2 H c 4 G c c 83 b 2 H b 4 G c c. 84 We know that the solution for the dark matter growth has the solution c c o n s t a n t a a. 85 Substituting this result into eqn. 84 for the baryon evolution, we can write it as a3 2 d da 1 a1 2 d b da 2 d b da 3 2 , 86 where we have assumed an Einstein de Sitter matter dominated universe witha t2 3.T h i s equation has the growing solution b a a0 c a 1 C a , 87 where C is some constant. This solution thus shows that b ! c for a C,e v e ni ff o r example b 0a ts o m ea C adec.I n o t h e r w o r d s ,b a r y o n i c p e r t u r b a t i o n s q u i c k l y c a t c h up with dark matter preturbations after decoupling. This in turn allows us to understand how the \ufb02uctuations in the baryons can be so small b T T 10 5 at decoupling, as implied by the CMB anisotropy level, but nevertheless grow to form large non linear 14 structures today. Whereas baryons are coupled to the photons prior to decoupling and thus have a horizon size Jeans scale gigantic Jeans mass , the dark matter only interacts gravitationally and \ufb02uctuations have been growing all along. 4 Understanding the Power Spectrum In\ufb02ation predicts a nearly scale invariant power spectrum which can be quanti\ufb01ed in terms of the rms \ufb02uctuations 2 of the Newtonian gravitational potential, in other words at some initial time ti when the \ufb02uctuations were put in place 2 k,t i d 2 d ln k k3 2 2 P k,t i c o n s t a n t P k,t i k 3. 88 From the perturbed Poisson s equationr2 4 Ga2 0 , so in Fourier space we get k2 4 Ga2 0 P k4P k P k k, 89 thus in\ufb02ation predictsP k kn with n 1. Comparing this to the matter power spectrum, we see that on large scales,k kpeak 0.06 Mpc 1, P k k as expected, but on small scales, k kpeak, P k k 3, seemingly violating the prediction from in\ufb02ation. How can we understand the shape of the power spectrum? 4.1 Super Horizon Growth of Perturbations Our treatment thus far has been purely Newtonian which is an action at a distance theory. As such it cannot deal with the fact that in an expanding spacetime there exist particle horizons that limit the distance between causally connected regions of the universe. In\ufb02ation creates perturbations on all scales including super horizon scales. Fluctuations that were generated during in\ufb02ation are constantly entering the horizon as the universe expands. This notion of super horizon \ufb02uctuations is necessary to understand the peak in the matter power spectrum, P k , and why it deviates from the scale invariant prediction from in\ufb02ationP k k on small scales. Only GR can properly treat the evolution of \ufb02uctuations comparable or greater than the horizon scale. This is beyond the scope of this course so we will instead proceed heuristically. First, let s review what we know about horizons. 4.1.1 Horizons Previously we showed that if the the energy density is dominated by a single energy compo nent with equation of statew such that the pressure is P w c2, 90 then the \ufb02uid equation implies that a 3 1 w , 91 15 and the Friedmann equation ignoring curvature then reads H2 8 G 3c2 aH 1 H 1 0 a 1 3w 2, 92 such that the comoving particle horizon is dph a Z t ti cdt a Z a ai da a a Z ln a ln ai aH 1d ln a 2cH 1 0 1 3 w h a 1 3w 2 a 1 3w 2 i i . 93 Previously we argued that in\ufb02ation causes the horizon to diverge solving the horizon problem. Here we are interested in understanding the evolution of density \ufb02uctuations that were put in place by in\ufb02ation, soai is here some very small scale factor after in\ufb02ation. This implies the ai term in the equation above is basically zero, and we have dph a 2cH 1 0 1 3 wa 1 3w 2. 94 The particle horizon is a comoving distance, but for the moment, let s consider the proper particle horizon at this scale factora rph a adph a 2cH 1 0 1 3 wa3 1 w 2 95 Note however that for this same model of a single energy component dominating the energy contents of the Universe, we showed in lecture4 that a t 2 3 1 w , 96 and thus 2H 1 0 3 1 w a3 1 w 2 t, 97 or rph t 1 w 3ct 1 3 w . 98 For a matter dominated universe w 0 ,rph t 3 ct,w h e r e a sf o rr a d i a t i o nd o m i n a t i o n w 1 3 , rph t 2 ct.T h u st h ep r o p e rp a r t i c l eh o r i z o ni sa l w a y so fo r d e rrph t ct. Now consider how the proper size prop of a perturbation with comoving wavelength evolves with time. We know that prop a t ,a n dg i v e nt h es c a l i n gf o ra t i m p l i e db ye q n . 9 7 we see that rph 2 ct prop a t t1 2 r a d i a t i o n d o m i n a t e d rph 3 ct prop a t t2 3 m a t t e r d o m i n a t e d. 99 Thus the proper size of a comoving perturbation has a shallower time evolution than the proper particle horizonrph. This faster evolution of the horizon size means that modes which are initially outside of the horizon will at some time enter the horizon as the universe expands 16 because the horizon grows faster and catches up with the proper scale. This is illustrated in Fig. 1. Figure 1 A \ufb02uctuation which is superhorizon scale at matter radiation equality grows always, while a \ufb02uctuation which enters the horizon during the radiation dominated era stops growing in amplitude until the matter dominated era begins. Figure from Norman arxiv e print 1005.1100. 4.1.2 Sub Horizon Growth Rates The reason why this notion of horizon entry is so important is that modes evolve di erently outside of the horizon than they do when they are inside the horizon. Let s \ufb01rst recap how sub horizon density perturbations grow and also consider how the gravitational potential evolves. We will restrict attention to the cold dark matter, which means we can ignore the e ect of free streaming, which we will discuss next. From our perturbation theory analyses we learned that sub horizon modes grow as the scale factor during matter domination a t , but grow at most logarithmically ln a t d u r i n gr a d i a t i o nd o m i n a t i o n t h eMezsaros e ect k,t k,t i ln a t ai r a d i a t i o n d o m i n a t e d a t ai matter dominated 100 17 Now consider the graviational potential perturbation x,t , which we can write x,t Z d3k 2 3 k,t eik x, 101 The perturbed Poisson equation can be written ink space as r2 4 Ga2 0 k2 k,t 4 Ga2 0 k,t k,t k,t 0 a a2. 102 Accordingly, the sub horizon evolution of the potential perturbation obeys k,t k,t i a ai 2 radiation dominated constant matter dominated , 103 where we used the scalings in eqn. 100 for k,t a n di g n o r e dt h el o g a r t h m i cd e p e n d e n c e during radiation domination given that is multiplied by a steepera 2 time evolution. Thus the potential perturbations decay asa 2 during radiation domination because of the Mezsaros e ect, but are frozen in at a constant during matter domination. 4.1.3 Super Horizon Growth Rates Crudely speaking, a super horizon perturbation prop r ph doesn t know it is a perturba tion as it has no causal knowledge of the metric on scales larger than itself. It is essentially an island universe which evolves independently of the regions it is causally disconnected from. In GR perturbation theory, the gravitational potential of these \ufb02uctuations is the perturbation to the metric. The upshot is that these super horizon metric perturbations do not evolve, they are frozen in and thus we have the result that for these modes the potential perturbation is constant in time. Hence for modes with k k H 2 dph k,t k , 104 is constant in time. From Poisson s equation ink space see eqn. 102 k2 k 4 Ga2 0 t k,t k,t constant 0a2 . 105 Thus for the growth rate of super horizon density \ufb02uctuations we have that k,t k,t i a ai 2 radiation dominated a ai matter dominated 106 We now begin to better understand why we need to keep track of when modes enter the horizon. As shown in Fig. 1, small scale modes will enter the horizon at early times when the universe is radiation dominated, at which point their density will stop growing actually it 18 Table 1 Growth Rates of Density Perturbations radiation dominated matter dominated sub horizon a 2 ln a constant a super horizon constant a2 constant a can grow up to logarithmically depending on initial conditions, but just assume it is constant for now , and its potential will decay asa 2,b e c a u s eo ft h eM e z s a r o se e c t . L a r g e rs c a l e modes which cross the horizon later during matter domination never go through this phase of stunted growth rate or equivalently potential decay. The di erent growth rates for sub horizon and super horizon \ufb02uctuations in the potential, , and density ,f o rr a d i a t i o na n d matter dominated universes are summarized in Table 1. 4.2 Understanding the Power Spectrum Shape We have now put the pieces together necessary to understand how the linear theory power spectrum gets its shape. There are two important things to highlight before we proceed. Much easier to work with potential \ufb02uctuations In terms of how the perturbations evolve in the di erent regimes, i.e. sub horizon vs. super horizon and radiation vs. matter dominated, it is clearly much easier to work with the potential, since Table 1, indicates that the potential \ufb02uctuation basically remains constant in time in all but one case, sub horizon \ufb02uctuations in a radiation dominated universe, where we see that it decays asa 2 due to the Mezsaros e ect. Horizon at Matter Radiation EqualityIt is clear that the comoving particle horizon at matter radiation equality,deq dph aeq , is an important physical scale. Because the particle horizon is a monotically increasing function ofa,m o d e sw i t hac o m o v i n gs i z e d eq larger than the horizon at matter radiation equality entered the horizon when the universe was matter dominated, whereas smaller modes d eq entered the horizon when the universe was still radiation dominated see Fig. 1 . It is only the latter set of small scale modes which will have their potentials decay due to the Mezsaros e ect. The comoving horizon at matter radiation equality is deq dph aeq 2 p 2 1 cH 1 0 m 1 zeq 1 2 1 1 0M p c 1 0 7 where we used 1 zeq 3 5 0 0 m,0 0.30 h 0.70 , 108 which we previously calculated. Since we are working with the power spectrum, it is more convenient to work with wavenumbers and we introduce keq 2 deq 0 .06 Mpc 1. 109 19 Ti Now let s consider an initial potential perturbation k,t i a ts o m et i m eti teq,w h e r e teq is the time of matter radiation equality, which we would like to evolve forward to some later time after decouplingt t dec,b u tf o rw h i c ht h eu n i v e r s ei ss t i l lm a t t e rd o m i n a t e d . For concreteness we will focus on a dark matter perturbation, which dominates the matter, and anyway as we saw in 3.3, the baryons will start tracking the dark matter perturbation shortly after decoupling. Consider modes with k k eq d eq , which will have entered the horizon when the universe was matter dominated. For both the super horizon and sub horizon evolution of these modes the potential perturbation remains constant and thus k,t k,t i k k eq . 110 Now consider smaller scale modes withk k eq d eq . These modes entered the horizon with potential perturbation at the value k,t i w h i c hw a sc o n s t a n ti nt i m e ,b u tu p o nh o r i zon entry, because the universe is radiation dominated, they su era 2 attenuation because of the Mezsaros e ect until the epoch of matter radiation equality k,t k,t i aenter k aeq 2 k k eq ., 111 where aenter k is the scale factor at which the modek entered the horizon, and the factor aenter aeq 2 re\ufb02ects the attenuation which occurs between the timeaenter k a n daeq.A t later times a a eq the universe is no longer radiation dominated, and so the potential will then remain at a constant value until the timet recall we assumed that att we are matter dominated . Notice that the timetenter at which the modek with wavelength enters the horizon during radiation domination is \ufb01xed by the evolution of the particle horizon that we computed in eqn. 99 above in 4.1.1 aenter k aenter 2 k 2 ctenter aenterk 1 tenter. 112 But we also have that during radiation dominationa t1 2,s oc o m b i n i n gt h e s et w op r o p o r tionalities we have aenter k k 1 tenter a2 enter k aenter k 1, 113 which states that high k small scale modes entered the horizon earlier in time, which can be clearly visualized from Fig. 1. This implies we can write the ratio aenter k aeq 2 keq k 2 . 114 20 Thus we obtain k,t k,t i k k eq k,t i keq k 2 k k eq . 115 Now using h k,t k0,t i 2 3 D k k0 P k,t , 116 we have P k,t P k,t i k k eq P k,t i keq k 4 k k eq . 117 As we mentioned before, in\ufb02ation predicts a scale invariant power spectrum of potential \ufb02uctuations, which has equal contribution to the variance from all scales 2 k,t i d 2 d ln k k3 2 2 P k,t i c o n s t a n t P k,t i k 3. 118 But the perturbed Poisson s equation eqn. 102 gives k2 k,t 4 Ga2 0 k,t k,t k2 k,t , 119 which implies the density and potential power spectra are related via P k4P k P k,t i Ak, 120 where A is a constant. So we \ufb01nally obtain P k,t Ak k k eq Ak keq k 4 k 3 k k eq , 121 which explains the shape of the linear theory power spectrum for the overdensity ,a n dw h y the break in the shape occurs aroundkeq 0 .06 Mpc 1. In reality the attenuation during radiation domination is more like lna a2, and furthermore the transition from radiation to matter domination is smooth, which smooths out the peak in the power spectrum. 4.3 Transfer Function What we have gone through in the last section is a simple analytical version of what the so called transfer function is supposed to achieve. Namely, our goal is to write the linear theory power spectrum for overdensity \ufb02uctuations at some timet as P k,t P k,t i T2 k D2 t , 122 where P k,t i i st h ep o w e rs p e c t r u ma tt h et i m ea tw h i c ht h ep e r t u r b a t i o n sw e r ec r e a t e d i.e. after in\ufb02ation ,D t i st h el i n e a rg r o w t hr a t et h a tw ed e \ufb01 n e de a r l i e r ,a n dT2 k i st h e transfer function. The transfer function can be written in terms of a relationship between the mode amplitude 21 o Figure 2 The variation of the density contrast in photons red , baryons green and CDM blue with scale factor fork 0 .01 Mpc 1 top andk 1 .0M p c 1 bottom . The density contrasts are plotted in the conformal Newtonian gauge. Note the change in behavior for the small scale modes aroundaeq 3 10 4, and decoupling atadec 10 3. Figure from Challinor. at a creation scale factorai time ti , and the mode amplitude at some scale factoram time tm . Typically am is taken to be a time when the universe is still matter dominated, but where am is after recombination. Broadly speaking, the reason for choosingam to be an epoch after recombination is simply that prior to recombination the universe is opaque and 22 structure is not observable. Thus one has T k k,t m k,t i , 123 Note the transfer function is independent of the exact value of scale factoram,p r o v i d e d am is chosen to be when the universe is still matter dominated since at this point there are no other physical e ects which could change the power spectrum shape in ak dependent fashion until the universe starts to become dominated. The transfer function models all the procceses that in\ufb02uence the growth of perturbations from formation until after recombination. We have discussed some but not all of these. The main complication that we have ignored is related to the validity of the \ufb02uid approximation, which we discuss in the next section. There are many publicly avaialble codes to compute T k . The major innovation was CMBFAST by Seljak and Zaldarriaga, as they \ufb01gured out a trick to perform the required Boltzmann equation integrations much faster than was previously possible. There are now other codes that supercede CMBFAST in accuracy and ease of use like CMBEASY, CAMB, CLASS, and PyCosmo. In Fig. 2 we show transfer functions from one of these codes for photons, baryons, and CDM for modes of two di erent sizes, one withk k eq,w h e r e a st h eo t h e rh a sk k eq. For the small scall modes lower panel , which are Jeans stable k k J or J b e f o r e recombination, we see acoustic oscillations in the tightly coupled photon baryon \ufb02uid begin after horizon entry a 10 5, and then we observe the baryons catching up to the dark matter after recombination when the Jeans mass plummets. You can also see a change in the growth rate of the CDM perturbation blue aroundaeq 3 10 4 illustrating the Meszaros e ect. Note that density contrast mode amplitudes appear to not evolve when they are outside the horizon, which appears to run contrary to our discussion in this section, i.e. see Table 1. This results from gauge freedom, i.e. our description of how super horizon modes evolve in 4.1.3 was necessarily gauge dependent. Typically papers on the evolution of T k compare results in di erent gauges. See for example Ma Bertschinger 1995 . 5 Hot, Cold, or Warm Dark Matter? 5.1 Free Streaming The \ufb02uid approximation that we have used in these notes is valid only when the mean free path of particles is much smaller than the spatial scale of the perturbation being considered. Otherwise, one has to use the Boltzmann equation to solve for the evolution of distribution functions. Perturbations in a nearly collisionless component e.g. neutrinos, warm or hot dark matter are subject to so called Landau damping, also known as collisionless phase mixing or free streaming.C o l d d a r k m a t t e r c a n b e t r e a t e d a s a p r e s s u r e l e s s \ufb02 u i d i n the limit that the particles are so massive that there is nofree streaming due to their random thermal velocities. But for hot or warm dark matter, which could have inherited signi\ufb01cant random thermal motions when the particles decoupled from the thermal bath, free streaming could be signi\ufb01cant. In such cases, one must use the Boltzmann equation to 23 solve for the evolution of perturbations comparable to the free streaming scale. A similar situation arises for photons after decoupling, when they are no longer tightly coupled to the baryons via Thompson scattering. As decoupling is approached, the photon mean free path becomes larger, and photons can di use out of overdense regions into underdense regions, thereby damping inhomogeneities in the photon baryon plasma, a phenomenon known as Silk damping. To properly study the evolution of perturbations in the radiation critical e.g. for the CMB and their back reaction on perturbations in matter, one must resort to solving the Boltzmann equation. The transfer function codes that we described in the last section solve the Boltzmann equa tion for various components dark matter, photons, neutrinos for which the \ufb02uid approxi mations are invalid. We won t go into solving the Boltzmann equation for collisionless \ufb02uids, since that is quite complicated. However, su ce it to say that something like the \ufb02uid equations comes out, where the pressure is instead contributed by the random motions of the collisionless particles. The same type of linear perturbation theory analysis leads one to conclude that scales larger than a Jeans scale are unstable to gravitational collapse J v G 1 2 , 124 where the velocityv replaces the sound speedcs that we had before where v 2 R v 2f v d3vR f v d3v h v 2i, 125 where f v is the collisionless particle i.e. dark matter velocity distribution function. For example for a Maxwellian velocity distribution functionv . Just like before, small scale modesk k J give rise to oscillatory solutions, but the crucial di erence is that these free streaming motions rapidly dissipate \ufb02uctuations with FS. Whereas in a \ufb02uid with pressure, you set up oscillations, which could eventually turn into a growing mode for example if the Jeans scale rapidly drops i.e. baryons after recombination , in this collisionless case, the \ufb02uctuations are actually erased because particles in an overdense region can propagate to an underdense region rapidly equalizing any density \ufb02uctuations. Here we will simply estimate what the free streaming length scale is, which you also did on the homework. Once a collisonless species decouples from the thermal bath, which we typically imagine to be an extremely early timetf when the particle froze out, it simply travels along a geodesic in an expanding Universe. We will assume that the particles motion is along a ray withd d 0 ,s ot h a tt h ep r o p e rd i s t a n c et h a tt h i sp a r t i c l et r a v e l si n an expanding universe is justa t dx v t dt,w h e r edx is a di erential comoving distance.

As each unit goes non linear, it will in general be comprised of a number of smaller condensations which had gone non linear and collapsed earlier. This behavior is a direct result of the shape of the power spectrum of cold dark matter. Hot dark matter models which have a small scale cuto at very large mass scalesM 1015M , form structures in a very di erent manner. Namely, the \ufb01rst structures to go non linear are large structures, where there is still power present. These large non linear structures then fragment to form smaller non linear structures.

Since most of the observed structures in the universe like galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc. have a density constrast far in excess of unity, their formation can only be understood with a fully nonlinear theory. In the non linear regime the evolution of the density \ufb01eld can no longer be described with a simple growth rate D a . In general no analytic solutions exist. Because non linearity implies mode coupling, we no longer have a Gaussian random \ufb01eld. We previously discussed that this mostly arises due to phase correlations, but the power spectrum will also deviate from linear theory, and furthermore higher order moments besides the two point function are required to describe the statistical properties of the density \ufb01eld. An accurate treatment will of course require solving the equations of structure formation on a computer. But we can consider highly oversimpli\ufb01ed analytical approximations which allow us to build intuition about this non linear evolution which will prove very useful in undertsanding and interpreting these numerical results. 1 Spherical Collapse 1.1 Top Hat Perturbation for an 1 Universe Figure 1 Illustration of a top hat perturbation for the spherical collapse model. Figure from Vandenbosch. One of the most important nonlinear calculations in cosmology is spherical collapse for which an analytic fully non linear solution exists.

Hence, the turn around radius depends only on the initial overdensity i not on the actual mass enclosed by the shell . Note also that smaller perturbations have larger radii at turn around, which implies that they turnaround collapse later. Now let us focus on the evolution of the actual overdensity. The mean density r i n t e r i o r to some radiusr within the top hat perturbation is t 3M 4 r3 3M 4 A3 1 cos 3 , 18 whereas the mean density of the background is t 1 6 Gt2 1 6 GB2 sin 2 , 19 hence the actual overdensity of our spherical top hat region, according to the fully non linear spherical collapse model, is 1 t 9 2 sin 2 1 cos 3 , 20 where we have used thatA3 GMB 2.B e f o r e w e d i s c u s s t h i s s o l u t i o n i n f u r t h e r d e t a i l ,w e will \ufb01rst compare it to linear theory. 1.2 Comparison to Linear Theory One of the main uses of the spherical collapse model is that it allows us to obtain a mapping between the extrapolated linear theory evolution of perturbations and their fully non linear 5 evolution. This then provides a simple tool for determining when perturbations in the initial linear \ufb02uctuations go non linear and when they collapse. We will use this mapping when we discuss the Press Schecter model for the abundance of dark matter halos, which allows one to compute halo abundances analytically using only the linear theory power spectrum. According to linear perturbation theory, in an Einstein De Sitter universe perturbations grow according to lin D a a t2 3 lin i t ti 2 3 . 21 In order to compare our linear theory to the fully non linear spherical collapse solution, we need to determine how to normalize the linear theory solution, which amounts to matching the initial conditions of our spherical collapse calculation. To do this, we Taylor expand the non linear solution for the overdensity in eqn. 20 . Using sin 3 3! 5 5! ... 22 cos 1 2 2! 4 4! ..., 23 where we can ignore higher order terms, since the validity of linear theory requires 1, which impliest tta B and hence 1. Thus sin 2 3 6 5 120 2 6 36 1 2 10 24 1 cos 3 2 2 4 24 3 6 8 1 2 4 . 25 Combining we \ufb01nd that in the 1l i m i t 1 9 6 36 h 1 2 10 i 2 6 8 1 2 4 1 2 10 1 2 4 1 3 2 20 , 26 from which we conclude that 3 2 20 . 27 If we now use that t B sin B 3 6 , 28 we see that in the 1l i m i t 6t B 1 3 . 29 Substituting the above expression for into eqn. 27 for we \ufb01nally obtain that that for 6 t tta B,w h i c hi m p l i e s 1a n d 1, t 3 20 6t B 2 3 1 . 30 Thus as expected, we see that in the small regime, the spherical collapse solution recovers the t2 3 a behavior of linear theory. Noting that the linear theory solution follows lin i t ti 2 3 , 31 to match the smallt small and b e h a v i o ro ft h el i n e a ra n dn o n l i n e a rs o l u t i o n ,w ec a n evaluate both att ti,w h i c hi m p l i e s B 3ti 4 5 i 3 3 2 , 32 combining withA3 GMB 2 and the expression forM in eqn. 14 , we deduce that A 3ri 10 i . 33 Hence the non linear solution is completely speci\ufb01ed in terms of quantities atti. Note that since B only depends on ti and i, the time for turn around tta B and for collapse tcoll 2 B,o c c u rs i m u l t a n e o u s l yf o ra l lm a s ss h e l l s .F o r m a l l y ,a ttcoll all the mass collapses to a singularity, but we will return to what actually happens at collapse for a more realistic not perfectly spherically symmetric situation shortly. Next we want to study the linear evolution on the same clock as the non linear evolution. The equations above apply to 1, but we need to uset i ne q n . 7 f o rl a r g e r .T h u s we combine the two equations lin i t ti 2 3 t B sin 3 4 to obtain lin 3 5 3 4 2 3 sin 2 3 . 35 We have now expressed the linear theory solution in terms of the parameters of our fully non linear solution, allowing us to compare their predictions at di erent times. This mapping between linear and non linear evolution is very powerful. Given the linear theory evolution of a density \ufb02uctuation, we can then make statements about what the fully nonlinear density constrast should be assuming spherical collapse. Some relevant times are calculated in Table 1. When a region is at turnaround with and t tta and is detatching from the Hubble \ufb02ow, 4 .6, so the characteristic overdensity of regions turning around is ta 4 .6! Furthermore, at this time, the linear theory contrast is 7 lin,ta 1 .06. Consider a region that had a linear \ufb02uctuation of lin 0 .1a t z 2 0. 36 Our calculation thus implies it was at turnaround roughly at a tta a z 2 0 lin lin,ta 1 zta 1 2 0 lin lin,ta 1 zta 2.0. 37 Furthermore, according to Table 1, we learn that att 2 when the spherical collapse model implies collapse to a singularity, the linear theory density contrast is lin 1 .69. Thus if we extrapolate linear theory to have an overdensity lin 1.69, this corresponds to a region which hast t coll in the spherical collapse model. For this reason we de\ufb01ne the threshold c 1.69 38 as the critical overdensity for collapse.W e w i l l s e e t h a t c plays a very important role in Press Schecther theory. Although our derivation focused on a top hat perturbation with value i it can be shown that our treatment is also valid for any monotonically decreasing with r p e r t u r b a t i o n ,w i t ht h eu n d e r s t a n d i n gt h a tw et h e nr e p l a c e with . As for the cosmological model, our results were computed for an Einstein De Sitter universe, but it turns out the critical density for collapse c is also remarkably insensitive to cosmology. What are the turnaround and collapse redshifts of a perurbation atz 1 0 0w h i c hh a s i 0 .1?

In the idealized spherically symmetric calculation we performed, this shell crossing \ufb01nally happens at 2 , which is the instant when all the mass collapses to a point. However, long before this happens the approximation that the matter is distributed in perfectly spherically symmetric shells, and that the random i.e. non radial velocities of the particles are small, will break down. The collisionless matter we are considering will reach what is known asvirial equilibrium by a process known asviolent relaxation. Violent relaxation occurs as follows. During the collapse there will be large \ufb02uctuations in the gravitational potential, on a time scale or order of the free fall collapse timetdyn G 1 2.S i n c e t h e p o t e n t i a l i s c h a n g i n g w i t h time, individual particles do not follow energy conserving orbits. The change in energy of a particle over this collapse timescale will depend in a complex way on its initial position and velocity, but the net e ect will be to redistribute energy among the particles and widen the range of energies available to the particles. Thus a rapidly time variable potential provides am e c h a n i s mf o rp a r t i c l e st oe x c h a n g ee n e r g ya n dr e l a xt oa ne q u i l i b r i u md i s t r i b u t i o no na timescale tdyn which is much shorter than the 2 body relaxation timescaletrelax Ntdyn 10 lnN , which is normally the timescale which governs the evolution of a self gravitating distribution of N particles. Since the dark matter particle mass is likely extremely small, the 2 body relaxation time would be many orders of magnitude larger than the Hubble time trelax tH. Violent relaxation operates much faster, and allows energy exchange ontdyn because of the rapidly varying gravitational potential. The end result of violent relaxation will be that the system arives in a quasi static equilibrium state1 in which its random motions provide the equivalent of pressure support against gravity. This equilibrium is known asvirial equilibrium.T h e v i r i a l t h e o r e m s t a t e s t h a t any bound system of particles interacting via forces will obey I 2 U 4 K, 39 where I is the moment of inertia of the system andU and K are the aggregate potential and kinetic energy of the system, respectively. Note that previously in eqn. 9 we derived expressions for the speci\ufb01c energyE U K,w h e r eU and K are the potential and kinetic energy per unit mass of the mass shell in question. These are distinct from the energies in the virial theorem which represent the total potential and kinetic energy of the system.

These collapsed objects are known asdark matter halos. Although spherical collapse captures some of the physics governing the formation of halos, structure formation in a cold dark matter universe proceeds hierarchically. At early times, most of the dark matter was in low mass halos, and these halos then continously accreted and merged to form high mass halos. Using high resolutionN body simulations to model gravitational instability of collisionless cold dark matter CDM particles with initial condi tions drawn from the linear theory power spectrumP k , Navarro et al. 1996 showed that the spherically averaged density pro\ufb01les of the resulting halos are described by a roughly uni versal function although there is considerable scatter among di erent halos. This so called NFW short for Navarro Frenk White pro\ufb01le has the form r s r rs 1 r rs 2 , 52 which is completely characterized by two parameters, massMvir and the concentration pa rameter c rvir rs. Here rvir is related to Mvir via eqn. 51 and the spherical collapse overdensity vir.T h eq u a n t i t y s is given by s m z vir c3 3f c , 53 where m z crit z m z 1 z 3 m0 3H2 0 8 G, 54 and f x l n 1 x x 1 x. 55 The corresonding mass pro\ufb01le is M r Mvir f cx f c x r rvir . 56 The concentration parameterc c M,z is a function of the halo mass and time. Actually it is more appropriate to think of the concenration as a function of halo mass and formation redshift, since halos which collapse earlier are more dense.

The spherical collapse model taught us that if we linearly extrapolate the growth of perturbations forward in time regions with x,t c 1.686, 58 will have collapsed to produce dark matter haloes by timet. In this section, we examine how we can assign a dark halo mass to some location in the linear density \ufb01eld which has x,t c, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Schematic illustration of the linear theory density \ufb01eld along a slice in position. Regions that are above the linear theory collapse threshold c 1 .686 should have collapsed to form dark matter halos. According to the spherical collapse model, regions with x,t c will have collapsed to produce dark matter halos by timet.W ec a na l s ov i e wt h i ss i t u a t i o nd i e r e n t l y ,e x p l o i t i n g that x,t D t 0 x , we can instead imagine that regions with 0 x c D t , 59 13 will have collapsed to produce dark matter halos by timet.I n t h i s l a t t e r c a s e , w e c o n s i d e r the linear density \ufb01eld to be static at the value extrapolated to our reference timet0,w h i l e the collapse barrier evolves with time, getting progressively lower as the growth factor D t increases with time toward unity. In the Press Schechter formalism, this latter way of viewing the barrier as decreasing with time will be the preferred approach. Previously, when discussing statistical measures of the density \ufb01eld, we de\ufb01ned therelative mass excess M x MR MR Z d3k 2 3 k W k eik x, 60 which is just a smoothed version of the density \ufb01eld. We argued that the variance of this random \ufb01eld two point correlation at zero lag can be written 2 R h 2 M x i Z 1 0 2 k W2 k d ln k, 61 from the convolution theorem and the de\ufb01nition of the power spectrum.

Previously we argued that the mass variance is a good proxy for the progression of structure formation on a given scale, and noted that for a power law power spectrumP k Akn the resulting scaling 2 M R R n 3 M n 3 3, 64 implies that small scale structures go non linear at earlier times, giving rise tohiearchical structure formation.T h em a s sv a r i a n c ea saf u n c t i o no fs c a l eR is shown in Fig. 6.

Figure from Barkana and Loeb. The idea behind the Press Schechter model for the abundance of dark matter halos is ex ceedingly simple. Press Schechter 1974 postulated that the probability that M c t is the same as the mass fraction that at timet is contained in halos with mass greater than 15 M. The probability that M c t can be easily calculated. For a Gaussian random \ufb01eld, one has that P M c t 1p 2 M Z 1 c t exp 2 M 2 2 M d M 1 2 erfc c t p 2 M , 66 where erfc x 1 erf x i st h ec o m p l i m e n t a r ye r r o rf u n c t i o n ,a n dw h e r ea g a i n c t c D t , such that the collapse barrier evolves downard with time. According to the Press Schecter postulate above, we thus have F M ,t 1 2 erfc c t p 2 M , 67 where F M , t is the fraction of the total mass in the Universe in collapsed halos with mass larger thanM at time t. There is however a serious problem with the Press Schecter postulate. AsM ! 0, then M !1 ,a sc a nb es e e nf r o mt h es c a l i n gr e l a t i o n si ne q n . 6 4 t h i sa s s u m e st h a t n 3, which is the case for CDM power spectra, hence M w i l la l w a y sb ead e c r e a s i n g function ofM .

This necessarily results from the Press Schecter postulate of associating positive linear theory density \ufb02uctucations with collapsed structures, and the fact that we are dealing with a Gaussian random \ufb01eld which is symmetric about zero, implying that the cumulative probability for a positive density \ufb02uctuation is P 0 1 2. 68 In linear theory, where \ufb02uctuations grow proportional to the linear growth rate x,t D a , the positive \ufb02uctuations become more positive, and the negative \ufb02uctuations become more negative, and so there is no way for the half of the volume of the universe corresponding to negative \ufb02uctuations to contain collapsed objects. However, underdense regions can be enclosed within larger overdense regions, giving them a \ufb01nite probability of being included in a larger collapsed object, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Press Schechter argued, without a proper demonstration, that the material in initially underdense regions will eventually be accreted by the collapsed objects, doubling their masses without changing the shape of the mass function. They thus solved this problem by simply introducing afudge factor of a factor of 2, and instead adopted F M ,t 2 P M c t erfc c t p 2 M . 69 The quantityF M ,t g i v e st h ec u m u l a t i v ed i s t r i b u t i o no ft h em a s s e so fc o l l a p s e do b j e c t s at any timet.A m o r e u s e f u l q u a n t i t y i s t h e s o c a l l e d m a s s f u n c t i o n , w h i c h i s t h e n u m b e r 16 Figure 7 Schematic illustration of the linear theory density \ufb01eld along a slice in position.

Figure from Barkana and Loeb. 18 The PS formalism provides an extremely useful way to understand how nonlinear structure forms in a hierarchical model. As can be seen from eqn. 72 , halos with massM can only form in a signi\ufb01cant number when M c t . 76 We can de\ufb01ne a characterstic massM t b yt h ec o n d i t i o nt h a t M t c t c D t , 77 where c 1 .686 is the linear collapse threshold from the spherical collapse model andD t is the linear growth factor. This can be visualized in Figure 6 where one sees thatM t is the value ofM at which the horizontal dotted lines indicating c t a ta n yt,i n t e r s e c t s M . From the equations above and the PS mass function, we see that only halos with M .

Thus the exponent above varies from 6t o 4, and is thus a strongly increasing function of time. Thus, as time passes, more and more massive halos will start to go nonlinear and form. The PS mass function is plotted in Fig. 8 for several di erent redshifts. We see that the mass function has a power law form which is attenuated by an exponential at the higest masses.

Density \ufb02uctuations present at the time of decoupling source \ufb02uctuations in the CMB temperature both through their coupling to the radiation \ufb01eld and through their perturbation of the space time metric. This information is encoded in the power spectrum of temperature anisotropies which have been recently measured to unprecedented precision by the Planck satellite. The Planck all sky CMB map is shown in Fig. 1, and the temperature power spectrum is shown in Fig. 2. Our goal in this lecture is to relate the features in this power spectrum to what we have learned so far about structure formation. Figure 1 The anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background CMB as observed by Planck. 1 Spherical Harmonics Observations of the CMB provide us with microwave temperature maps of the entire sky. We need to be able to deal with a continuous spectrum of temperature \ufb02uctuations, and the natural way of doing this is to take the Fourier transform of the intensity distribution. The temperature \ufb02uctuations are distributed over the surface of a sphere, and so we need the two dimensional spherical polar equivalent of the relation between the density distribution and its power spectrum, which we derived previously when we related the amplitude of Fourier modes to the power spectrum in three Cartesian dimensions. For the surface of a sphere, the appropriate complete sets of orthonormal functions are the spherical harmonic functions. The \ufb01rst step is to make a spherical harmonic expansion of the temperature \ufb02uctuation over 1 Figure 2 Left The power spectrum of CMB temperature anisotropies as measured by Planck shown with power on a linear scale.Right The power spectrum of CMB temperature anisotropies measured by various di erent experiments shown with power on a log scale. the entire sky T T \u02c6n T \u02c6n T T 1X 0 m X m a mY m \u02c6n , 1 where the Y m are the orthonormal functions known as the spherical harmonics of degree and orderm,a n dt h eu n i tv e c t o r\u02c6n denotes some direction on the sky , .

For the density perturbation we de\ufb01ned the power spectrum via the two point correlation of the Fourier amplitudes, and used statistical isotropy and homogeneity to show that h k k0 i 2 3 D k k0 P k . 4 What is the implication of statistical isotropy and homogeneity for the two point correlation 2 of thea m? It turns out we must have ha ma 0m0 i C 0 mm0 , 5 where C is the angular power spectrum.B y s t a t i s t i c a l i s o t r o p y t h e r e s h o u l d b e n o preferred directions on the sky such that each of the 2 1 c o e c i e n t sa m provides an independent estimate of the amplitude of the temperature \ufb02uctuations associated with the multipole .T h ep o w e rs p e c t r u mC can thus be written C 1 2 1 X m a ma m h a m 2i. 6 Equivalent to the power spectrum description, we can de\ufb01ne an auto correlation function of the temperature \ufb02uctuations as C T T \u02c6n T T \u02c6n0 , 7 where cos \u02c6n \u02c6n0 is the angle between the two directions on the sky.

Finally, we will often need to know the relationship between multipole and angular scale .F o r s m a l l s e c t i o n s o f t h e s k y w h e r e i t s c u r v a t u r e c a n b e n e g l e c t e d , t h e s p h e r i c a l h a r m o n i c analysis becomes ordinary Fourier analysis on a \ufb02at two dimensional surface T T n X a mY m !

For these high multipoles which are well described by standard Fourier analysis, the angular scale corresponding to a given harmonic is obviously given by 2 .F o r l a r g e r a n g u l a r s c a l e s a n d l o w e r m u l t i p o l e s , where the spherical harmonics di er from Fourier modes, the angular scale corresponding to harmonic is roughly given by . 14 Note that the density \ufb02uctuations at decoupling are so small that they are de\ufb01nitely in the linear regime. Since we believe that in\ufb02ation gave rise to Gaussian initial conditions, and since we will see that the CMB temperature \ufb02uctuations are proportional to the density pe rurbations, the CMB temperature \ufb02uctuation is a Gaussian random \ufb01eld, which implies that the power spectrumC or equivalently the correlation functionC provides acomplete statistical description of the \ufb02uctuation distribution. This assumption of the Gaussianity of the CMB has been tested to high precision. 2 Physical Origin of Anisotropies 2.1 Overview We will now proceed to consider the physical origin of CMB anisotropies. First, one must distinguish betweenprimary anisotropieswhich are generated at the last scattering sur face, andsecondary anisotropies,w h i c ha r eg e n e r a t e db yp r o c e s s e sl i k ee l e c t r o ns c a t t e r i n g or gravitational redshifts that occur along the line of sight as the CMB photons propagate towards earth. Primary AnisotropiesThere are three basic primary e ects which are important on large, intermediate, and small angular scales, respectively. They are Superhorizon Fuctuations The Sachs Wolfe e ect is a source of temperature anisotropy due to gravitational parturbations at the last scattering surface. It generates 4 Figure 3 Illustration of the physical mechanisms that cause CMB anisotropies. The shaded arc on the right represents the last scattering shell. Inhomogeneities on this shell a ects the CMB through its potential density \ufb02uctuations on both super and sub horizon scales. Non zero velocities at last scattering give rise to Doppler perturbations. Further perturbations are added along the line of sight by time varying potentials ISW Rees Sciama e ect and by electron scattering from hot gas Sunyaev Zeldovich e ect . The density \ufb01eld at last scattering can be Fourier analyzed into modes of wavevectork. These spatial perturbation modes have a contribution that is in general damped by averaging over the shell of last scattering. Short wavelength modes are more heavily a ected i because more of them \ufb01t inside the scattering shell, and ii because their wavevectors point more nearly radially for ag i v e np r o j e c t e dw a v e l e n g t h . temperature anisotropies on a scale larger than the particle horizon at the last scat tering surface. Since causal processes cannot in\ufb02uence perturbation evolution on these scales, the temperature anisotropy results from the impact of the density potential \ufb02uctuations on the metric itself, making this a purely gravitational e ect. Subhorizon Fluctuations Below the horizon scale at the last scattering surface, causal processes like pressure forces and the propagation of sound waves can operate. The tightly coupled baryon photon \ufb02uid results in acoustic oscillations driven by the dark matter density potential \ufb02uctuations. Since the photons are tightly coupled to the baryons, the densities of the two \ufb02uids scale proportionately nb n n T3 b nbmb T3, 15 5 where the n T3 results from the fact that the photons are a black body radiation \ufb01eld. Di erentiating b T3, we \ufb01nd T T 1 3 b b b 3 . 16 Thus we see that \ufb02uctuations in the baryon density source CMB temperature anisotropies. These are often referred to as isentropic or adiabatic perturbations, which is actually a statement about the nature of the initial conditions on the modes before they entered the horizon. These initial conditions are set by the physics of in\ufb02ation, and isen tropic adiabatic initial conditions mean that the ratio of matter to radiation, which is equivalent to the entropy per baryon, is conserved. Doppler Flucutations The photon baryon \ufb02uid has a non zero velocity at last scattering. Scattering of CMB photons o of electrons with non zero velocities leads to Doppler shifts in photon frequency and hence in the temperature of the CMB. Secondary AnisotropiesThere are three primary sources of secondary anisotropies. We will not have time to discuss these and only mention them very brie\ufb02y Integrated Sachs Wolfe Rees Sciama E ectsresult from CMB photons travers ing time varying potentials along the line of sight. This sources additional temperature anisotropy. Sunyaev Zeldovich E ect When CMB photons encounter hot plasma along the line of sight they will be Compton up scattered to higher frequencies. The largest SZ signals are associated with foreground clusters of galaxies, which are large collapsed non linear structures at low redshift which have plasma temperatures ofT 107 K. Thomson Scattering from ReionizationWhen the universe is reionized atz 7 8 the free electrons can Thompson scatter CMB photons. This has as a small e ect on the temperature anisotropy pattern, but results in a large e ect on the polarization of the CMB, since Thompson scattering of a quadropole anisotropy produces linear polarization. Our strategy for understanding CMB anisotropies will be to start with the largest angular scales and progress to smaller scales. We will \ufb01rst learn about the Sachs Wolfe e ect, which is the dominant source of large angular scale anisotropy. Moving to smaller sub horizon angular scales brings in causal processes which complicates analysis. We will attempt to understand some of the characteristic behavior like the origin of the acoustic peaks at intermediate angular scales and the damping of \ufb02uctuations on small angular scales. Finally, we will conclude by describing how a full numerical calculation of the CMB power spectrum is performed by solving the Boltzmann equation, which will help us better understand the complexity of the physics. 6 2.2 Large Angular Scales 2.2.1 The Particle Horizon On the homework you computed the particle horizon at decoupling, and we similarly calcu lated this quantity when discussing in\ufb02ation rph tdec Z tdec 0 cdt a t 2 7 4c M p c. 17 This comoving distance corresponds to a proper distance ofdph adecdph tdec 0 .251 Mpc ctdec at tdec.W e p r e v i o u s l y f o u n d t h a tdA tdec 1 2 .8 Mpc, and hence a patch of the last scattering surface with size equal to the particle horizon will subtend an angle ph rph tdec dA tdec 1 zdec 1 .1 ph ph 1 6 3. 18 Thus any \ufb02uctuation with multipole . 160 represents a super horizon temperature \ufb02uctu ation. When we discussed structure formation, we argued that evolution of super horizon modes di ers signi\ufb01cantly from sub horizon modes. Whereas we could analyze the behavior of sub horizon \ufb02uctuations using Newtonian mechanics, as expressed by the Euler and continuity equations, we argued that super horizon \ufb02uctuations evolve di erently. A super horizon mode is not in causal contact with itself, and so things like sound waves cannot propagate across it. In GR perturbation theory, the gravitational potential of these \ufb02uctuations is the perturbation to the metric, and thus we have the result that for these modes the potential perturbation is constant in time. When we discussed the shape of the matter power spectrumP k , we argued that what were super horizon modes are constantly entering the horizon as the Universe expands be cause the horizon grows with time faster than the proper length scale or equivalently, a comoving length scale stays \ufb01xed with time but the comoving particle horizon grows with the expansion . Analogously, because the universe expanded by a factor of 1000 sincetdec, we are now able to see many horizon size 1 patches of the CMB that were not in causal contact with each other. The \ufb02uctuations on these scales retain their primordial character since they will not have been modi\ufb01ed by any causal processes inside the horizon beforetdec. These frozen in potential \ufb02uctuations thus contain unique information about the form of the unprocessed initial power spectrum of \ufb02uctuations put in place by in\ufb02ation. These can be directly measured via the Sachs Wolfe e ect, as we discuss next. 2.2.2 The Sachs Wolfe E ect On large scales the dominant contribution to T T is the Sachs Wolfe e ect. This is ar e l a t i v i s t i ce e c td u et ot h ef a c tt h a tp h o t o n st r a v e l l i n gt oa no b s e r v e rf r o mt h el a s t scattering surface encounter metric perturbations which cause them to change frequency. The Sachs Wolfe e ect is actually a manifestation of two releativistic e ects. 7 Gravitational Redshift Imagine an overdensity at recombination which gives rise to a gravitational potential \ufb02ucutation . First there will be a gravitational redshift resulting from the density \ufb02uctuations, and at decoupling the temperature re\ufb02ects a snapshot of the potential well the photons were in at the time of last scattering Einit Einit c2 z photon mass E\ufb01nal E E c2 . 19 But the photons obey the Bose Einstein distribution function fBE 1 eE kBT 1, 20 which is a conserved quantity. So this implies T T c2 . 21 Thus in an overdense region 0 there will be a net decrease of temperature T 0 due to the gravitational redshift of the photons. Time DilationIn the limit of weak \ufb01elds, one can write the perturbed FRW metric as ds2 1 2 c2 dt2 a t 1 2 c2 dx2 dy2 dz2 , 22 where the coordinate timet is the cosmic time of the background unperturbed model. Com pare a clock in the region with a potential perturbation t oo n ei nt h eb a c k g r o u n du n p e r turbed 0u n i v e r s e . T oc a l c u l a t et h ep r o p e rt i m ei n t e r v a ld in this perturbed universe, we want to evaluate the metric at \ufb01xed spatial coordinatesdx dy dz 0 ,w h i c hi m p l i e s d 2 ds2 1 2 c2 dt2 d r 1 2 c2 dt 1 c2 dt 1 c2 t, 23 so we conclude that in an overdense region 0 clocksrun slower. t t c2 24 But this implies that the universe has expanded less, and is thus denser than average and that must also mean that it is hotter since T a 1 dT da T a , 25 8 so we have T T a a . 26 But for a matter dominated universe a t t2 3 a a 2 3 dt t . 27 Combining the three equations above we \ufb01nd T T a a 2 3 dt t 2 3 c2 . 28 The physical interpretation is that because clocks run slower in an ovedense region 0 , the universe will be younger and thus e ectively hotter T 0. Note that this has the opposite sign of the gravitational redshift term above. Hence we learn that that the net temperature anisotropy generated from theSachs Wolfe e ect is T T SW T T time T T grav 2 3 c2 c2 1 3 c2 29 2.2.3 Measuring the Primordial Power Spectrum We can now understand why the dimensionless power spectrum 2 T 2C is essentially \ufb02at at low . 100. In order to relate eqn. 29 to the CMB power spectrum we need to do a bit of math. By expanding the potential into Fourier modes x,t Z d3k 2 3 k,t eik x, 30 and recalling that the perturbed Poisson equationr2 4 Ga2 0 we have k2 4 Ga2 0 P k4P k , 31 where P is the power spectrum of density \ufb02uctuations. Expanding the net Sachs Wolfe temperature perturbation in eqn. 29 in spherical harmonics, and averaging over all possible observer positions yields, after some math C h a m 2i 1 2 H0 c 4 Z 1 0 P k j kx dk k2 , 32 where j is a spherical Bessel function andx 2 c H0. Assuming that in\ufb02ation gives rise to a power law primordial power spectrumP k Akn the expression above is analytic. It is then straightforward to show that the dimensionless power spectrum 1 C 2 const, 33 9 for the scale free casen 1, which are the initial conditions setup by in\ufb02ation which give rise to 2 k3P k 2 2 c o n s t .

From the Planck website. 2.3 Intermediate Angular Scales The Acoustic Peaks 2.3.1 The Sound Horizon Before we delve into the physics of the acoustic oscillations, we will calculate the characterstic length scale below which they operate, which is the sound horizon at the last scattering surface. This is the maximum distance which sound waves could travel and undergo coherent oscillations. By analogy with the particle horizon it is de\ufb01ned as the comoving distance rs tdec Z tdec 0 csdt a t , 34 1The so called integrated Sachs Wolfe e ect makes this slightly more complicated, but we ignore that order 10 e ect here. 10 which corresponds to the proper distance rs,prop adecrs tdec cstdec,w h e r ecs is the sound speed of the photon baryon \ufb02uid. The sound horizon therefore sets an upper limit to the wavelengths which acoustic waves could have at the epoch of recombination. In the homework you showed that the sound speed of the photon baryon \ufb02uid can be written cs P 1 2 S cp 3 3 b 4 1 1 2 cp 3 1 R , 35 where R zdec 3 b 4 3 b0 critc4 16 T 4 0 1 zdec 3 .045 104 b0h2 1 zdec 0 .685, 36 for our reference parameters atzdec 1 0 9 0 ,w h e r e is the Stefan Boltzmann constant. Thus the speed of sound at the last scattering layer wascs 0 .445c, whereas at earlier times when the universe is radiation dominatedcs c p 3 0 .577c,w h i c hi st h es o u n ds p e e do faf u l l y relativistic plasma. It is reasonable to just approximatecs c p 3i ne q n . 3 4 ,f r o mw h i c h we \ufb01nd thatrs rph p 3 rs tdec Z tdec 0 csdt a t 1p 3 Z tdec 0 cdt a t 1 5 8c M p c, 37 or a proper size ofdph 0 .145 Mpc, which implies s rs tdec dA tdec 1 zdec 0 .7 s s 2 8 0. 38 The size of the sound horizon at decoupling sets the characteristic angular scale of the acoustic peaks seen in the CMB power spectrum in Fig. 2. Inspection of the CMB power spectra in Fig. 2 indicates that the \ufb01rst peak in the power occurs at around this multipole, and that the other peaks in the spectrum occur at what appear to be harmonics of this multipole. The reason for this is that on small scales below the sound horizon, the amplitude of the Fourier modes exhibit temporal oscillations. Modes that are caught at maxima or minima of their oscillation attdec correspond to peaks in the power. Because sound takes half as long to travel half as far, modes corresponding to peaks follow a harmonic relationship. Let s try to understand the physics of this in more detail. 2.3.2 Acoustic Oscillations Our analysis in this section will be necessarily approximate and aims to heuristically illustrate the basic physics behind the acoustic oscillations. The full treatment requires solving the Boltzmann equation in GR, which is beyond the scope of this course, although we sketch out the general approach in the next section. Unlike our analysis of the SW e ect, on sub horizon scales causal processes related to the motion of the \ufb02uid in the DM potential wells, the compensating pressure gradients, and the resulting sound waves all have time to operate. Previously we discussed the coupled perurbations of dark matter and the tightly coupled photon baryon \ufb02uid before recombination in the context of linear perturbation theory. We 11 wrote down the following equations c 2 H c 4 G c c b b 4 G c c 39 b 2 H b c2 sk2 a2 b 4 G c c b b c2 sk2 a2 4 G c c, 40 where in the last equality we have assumed that the dark matter dominates the matter content. Since the dark matter dominates the gravity and the expansion rate, the universe is Einstein de Sitter and matter dominated, and eqn. 39 for the dark matter yields the growing solution a t w h i c hw es t u d i e db e f o r e . T h u st h e4 G c c in the baryon evolution equation can be thought of as an external driving term. Given the pressure term in the evolution equation for the baryons, the Jeans scale J csH 1 cH 1 is comparable to the sound horizon we expect to see acoustic oscillations. Since here we are focusing on the acoustic oscillations, the timescale of interest is the sound crossing time ts cs a kcs , 41 and in our approximate treatment we can thus ignore the Hubble drag term in eqn. 40 relative to the other terms involving b,i . e . 2H b b t b b t2 s 2 H b k2c2 s a2 b b t2 s . 42 We can also use the perturbed Poisson equation for the dark matter r2 c 4 Ga2 c c k2 c k,t 4 Ga2 c c k,t , 43 to replace 4 G c c with k2 c k,t a2. Thus we can \ufb01nally recast the evolution equation for the baryons eqn. 40 as b k2c2 s a2 b k2 a2 c. 44 Now note that at early times around recombination, the universe will be matter dominated and Einstein de Sitter with tot 1 ,a n di nt h i sr e g i m ew es h o w e dp r e v i o u s l yt h a tl i n e a r theory predicts the potential perturbation does not evolve with time, so c k,t c k . The equation above is thus the equation of motion for a forced harmonic oscillator, with a constant forcing term. It admits solutions of the form b k, b k, 0 c c2 s cos kcs 1 kcs d b d k, 0 sin kcs c c2 s , 45 where we have introduced the conformal time as the new time variable, Z t 0 dt a t rs cs , 46 12 and have noted that the sound horizon is equal to the product of the sound speed and the conformal time. This equation states that b k,t o s c i l l a t e sa r o u n daz e r o p o i n t , c c2 s, with a frequency equal to! kcs,a n dw i t ha m p l i t u d ea n dp h a s es e tb yt h ei n i t i a lc o n d i t i o n s b k,t 0 a n dd b d k,t 0 . The motion of the photon baryon \ufb02uid will also source anisotropies due electron scattering. Using the perturbed continuity equation ink space b 1 ar vb 0 ik vb a b, 47 we can also obtain the time evolution of the corresponding baryon velocity perturbations vb k,t ik k2 d b d icsk k b k, 0 c c2 s sin kcs ik k2 d b d k, 0 cos kcs . 48 Note that there is a phase di erence of 2 between the velocity and density perturbations, as is characteristic of a longitudinal acoustic wave. How can we relate these density and velocity perturbations to the CMB temperature anisotropy T T ? First note that, as discussed at the beginning of 2.1, the CMB anistropy is sourced by multiple terms, namely the gravitational or SW e ect, ansitropy due to baryon \ufb02uctua tions, and Doppler shifts sourced by velocity \ufb02uctuations T T k,t T T grav T T T T v k,t c2 b k,t 3 1p 3 vb c , 49 where we have included the Sachs Wolfe gravitational redshift term T T grav k,t c2,a n du s e dt h er e l a t i o n s h i p T T b 3t h a tw ed e r i v e di ne q n . 1 6 .F o rt h eD o p p l e r velocity perturbation, we have used the fact that all three spatial directions should have the same rms value of the velocity, and so the Doppler line of sight contribution resulting from the motion of the \ufb02uid is just T T v vk c vb p 3 . 50 Let s focus on the \ufb01rst two terms \ufb01rst, namely the sum of the gravitational and density contributions to the anisotropy. These two terms typically called the e ective temperature \ufb02uctuation re\ufb02ect the observed temperature \ufb02uctuation due to gravitational redshifting of photons as they climb out of potential wells and compression rarefaction of the gas T T e T T grav T T k,t c2 b k,t 3 . 51 Plugging in our solution for b from eqn. 45 above we obtain T T e c c2 b k, 0 3 c 3c2 s cos kcs 1 3kcs d b d k, 0 sin kcs c 3c2 s . 52 13 Now usingcs c p 3 1 R , we can write this solution as T T e 0 k, 0 1 R cos kcs 1 kcs d 0 d k, 0 sin kcs R , 53 where we have introduced the new variables 0 b 3a n d c.L i k e w i s e , u s i n g eqn. 50 the Doppler component of the perturbation can be written T T v p 3cs c 0 k, 0 1 R c2 sin kcs p 3 k d 0 d k, 0 cos kcs . 54 For the moment, let us focus on the e ective temperature \ufb02uctuation, i.e. the gravity plus density term, which turns out to dominate the power. It is clear from the form of eqn. 53 , that the form of the acoustic oscillations is governed by the two initial conditions 0 k, 0 and d 0 d k, 0 , 55 at time 0 . I n s p e c t i o no fe q n . 5 3 b e g st h eq u e s t i o n w h ys h o u l dt h e r eb ea n ya c o u s t i c oscillations at all? When we observe the CMB at decoupling, we are basically taking a snapshot of the radiation \ufb01eld at dec,w h i c ha m o u n t st oe v a l u a t i n g T T e dec . If we superpose a large collection of modes with di erent wavelengths wavenumbersk a n d arbitrary phase i.e. set by the values of the initial conditions 0 k, 0 and d 0 d k, 0 , this should not result in a preferred scale that produces peaks in the power spectrum. Why do we observe peaks in the CMB power spectrum? To answer this question we \ufb01rst need to to be more clear about what we mean by initial conditions , that is what time is 0? The initial conditions for these acoustic oscillations should be set at the time at which causal physics begins to operate, in other words what we mean by 0 is actually the time at which a given mode entered the horizon. It turns out that in\ufb02ation can only excite so calledisentropic perturbationsfor which the ratio of the matter and radiation is a constant at horizon entry. These correspond to pure curvature \ufb02uctuations or perturbations to the metric on super horizon scales. They are called isentropic because a constant ratio of radiation to matter implies that the entropy per baryons nB is constant. The alternative are so calledisocurvature perturbationsfor which the entropy per baryon can \ufb02uctuate from point to point. This is achieved by for example allowing the baryon density to \ufb02uctuate on a \ufb01xed radiation backround. We won t be able to go into more detail about how these \ufb02uctuations are classi\ufb01ed, but the upshot is that isentropic \ufb02uctuations only excite the cosine term in eqn. 53 at horizon entry, in other words we have 0 k, 0 const d 0 d k, 0 0, 56 which corresponds to an initial metric perturbation, whereas isocurvature \ufb02uctuations excite the sine mode at horizon entry, which corresponds to zero initial metric perturbation. Now 14 recall the de\ufb01nition of the conformal time Z t 0 dt0 a t0 rph t c . 57 Thus for a given modek,h o r i z o nc r o s s i n go c c u r sa t rph h k c h k 2 k h k 2 ck . 58 The important thing to note is that the phase of an acoustic wave at horizon crossing is phase kcs h k 1, 59 is a constant of order unity which is independent ofk.T h u s ,t h ez e r op o i n to ft h ep h a s eo f every mode can be consistently set at horizon crossing, such that e ectively all the modes are setup with some initial amplitude of the cosine term in eqn. 53 . That fact that in\ufb02ation lines up the phases allows us to now understand what gives rise to the peaks in the CMB power spectrum. Given a collection of modes with wavenumber k,t h e r ew i l lb eas p e c i \ufb01 cs e to fm o d e st h a th a v ee x a c t l yt h er i g h tp h a s ea t dec such that they result in a compression or a rarefaction at the time of decoupling when the CMB is released, as illustrated in Fig. 5. The lowest acoustic peak in the CMB power spectrum, corresponding to the largest wavelength mode, will occur for the mode which has one half wavelength equal to the sound horizon k1rs k1cs dec , 60 where in the last equality we used that the sound horizon is justrs cs dec.T h e o t h e r higher and higherk peaks in the CMB power are modes that are integer multiples ofk1, which will also result in maximum compression or rarefaction at decoupling kncs dec n kn n rs nk1, 61 This is analogous to the condition for the resonant frequencies for standing waves in a pipe which is closed at each end, such that the pressure perturbation achieves maximum compression rarefaction at the boundaries, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Since the power spectrum is e ectively the square of the temperature perturbation T T ,b o t hm a x i m a h o ts p o t s a n d minima cold spots give rise to peaks in the power spectrum, as illustrated by Fig. 6 Now that we have understood the basic physical picture for the origin of the acoustic peaks, we can gain further insight into the shape of the CMB power spectrum with just a little more work. We argued that only the cosine term is excited, thus T T e 0 k, 0 1 R c2 cos kcs R c2 . 62 To determine the initial condition 0 k, 0 we consider the behavior of the equation above 15 as ! 0. This corresponds to horizon entry, at which time the causal physics that gives rise to the acoustic oscillations and the Doppler shifts that result from electron scattering, will not have time to operate. That is, at the earliest times our solution needs to be equal to the Sachs Wolfe anistropy that we derived previously, which implies 0 k, 0 c2 1 3 c2 0 k, 0 2 3 c2 . 63 Recall that is a constant in time recall density perutrbations grow asa,b u tp o t e n t i a l s are constant if the universe is matter dominated.

Therefore, the amplitude of the temperature \ufb02uctuation given by a Fourier mode with wavenumberk is determined by ,R,a n dt h ep h a s ekrs of the acoustic wave at the last scattering surface.

Inspection of Fig. 8 illustrates that this is indeed the case for the magenta curve labeled SW which shows the T T e contribution. This enhancement of the odd peaks relative to the even peaks occurs because the odd peaks correspond to compressions of the sound waves, and the inerita of the baryons as quanti\ufb01ed by theR factor enhances these relative to the rarefactions. The Doppler anisotropy should be 2o u to fp h a s ew i t ht h ee e c t i v et e m p e r a t u r e anistropy, because of the cos krs v ss i n krs , which we see is the case in Fig. 8 blue curve . Furthemore, the amplitude at the peaks of the Doppler term will not be as large as the e ective temperature term. As such, in the CMB power spectrumC the Doppler term peaks \ufb01ll the valleys between the peaks of e ective temperature rather than appearing as peaks themselves.

Because the sound horizonrs can be computed from \ufb01rst principles, it amounts to a standard ruler. Given that we can also calculate the redshift of decoupling from \ufb01rst principles, we can use this standard ruler rs and the known redshift of decouplingzdec to determine the angular diameter distance to the surface of last scatteringDA zdec . Because the angular diameter distance varies considerably for an open, \ufb02at, or closed universek 0 , 1, 1, the location of the \ufb01rst peak alone determines the the geometry of the metric.

This plot of the visibility function clearly indicates that CMB photons were not last scattered at a single redshift, but rather over a range of redshifts. The maximum of the visibility function occurs at a redshift ofz 1 0 9 0 ,w h i c hw ei d e n t i f ya s 18 the redshift of decoupling. It has half maxima lying at redshifts ofz 1 1 7 8a n dz 9 8 3 , corresponding to a redshift interval of z 195. For the benchmark cosmology, the redshift of the maximum of the visibility function correspondeds to an age of the universe oft 370, 000 years after the Big Bang, and most of the photons were last scattered between the epochs t 3 2 0, 000 andt 4 4 0, 000 years. Although the last scattering surface is not strictly speaking a surface, but rather a volume with a \ufb01nite thickeness, it is nevertheless su ciently thin that we can imagine it as acting like a kind of photon barrier, similar to the photosphere of the Sun. No information carried by photons originating fromz 1100 can reach the Earth, as the photons involved will be scattered many times. Let us work out the increment of comoving radial distance coordinate corresponding to the thickness of the last scattering layer. At large redshifts, we can neglect the vaccum energy relative to the matter density, and so an in\ufb01testimal interval of line of sight comoving distance is dr cdt a cdz H z cH 1 0 dz z3 2 1 2 m0 . 70 Taking the thickness of the last scattering layer to correspond to the redshift interval z 1178 983 195 atz 1 0 9 0a sw ec o m p u t e da b o v e ,t h ec o r r e s p o n d i n gc o m o v i n gr a d i a l distance is r 3 8M p c. 71 Although this is a distance along the line of sight, it is useful to calculate the angle on the sky it would project to, or equivalently the multipole 2 9 .5a r c m i n 2 2 2 7 0. 72 On comoving scales less than r 40 Mpc, corresponding to angles smaller than about . 10 arcmin or multipoles greater than 1000, because of the \ufb01nite thickness of the last scattering layer, we expect the observed CMB to result from a number of independent \ufb02uctuations along the line of sight through the last scattering layer. Consequently, the ran dom superposition of these perturbations leads to a statistical reduction in the amplitude of the observed intensity \ufb02uctuations by a factor of roughlyN 1 2,w h e r eN is the number of \ufb02uctuations of a given size probed along the line of sight, i.e.N r .T h e p o w e r spectrum of the CMB will thus be suppressed on this scale. This suppression is essentially just geometric, i.e. it results from the fact that the CMB cannot be treated as a thin surface for \ufb02uctuations comparable to the thickenss of the surface. This suppression of \ufb02uctuations for 1000 can be seen in the CMB power spectrum in Fig.??.T h e r e i s i n f a c t a s e c o n d source of suppression known asSilk Damping,d u et ot h ef a c tt h a tp h o t o n sc a nd i u s eo u t of overdensities via Thompson scattering. Analogous to free streaming, small scale \ufb02uctua tions will be suppressed. 19 3 The Boltzmann Equation Predicting the power spectrum of CMB anisotropies is a challenging task. Because it involves \ufb02uctuations in the relativistic photon baryon \ufb02uid on scales comparble to or in excess of the horizon, GR is required. The full apparatus of perturbing the Einstein gravitational \ufb01eld equations yields equations that are analogous to the equations we derived when studying linear structure formation in the Newtonian approximation. As we discussed previously when discussing transfer functions, additional complications arises because components like the photons at decoupling when the mean free path becomes large , neutrinos, or dark matter if there is signi\ufb01cant free streaming do not behave like a \ufb02uid and so the full Boltzmann equation must be solved. By considering the Boltzmann equation in GR, linearizing it, and then taking moments to derive equations like the \ufb02uid equations, one obtains a set of coupled di erential equations for the Fourier mode amplitudes of the various quantities of interest ik\u00b5 ik\u00b5 \u00b5vb vb a avb ik R vb 3 i 1 . 73 Here T T is the Fourier transform of the perturbation to the photon distribution function, x, \u02c6p,t , de\ufb01ned by f x,p ,\u02c6p,t exp p T t 1 x, \u02c6p,t 1 1 , 74 thus x, \u02c6p,t i st h ef r a c t i o n a lt e m p e r a t u r ep e r t u r b a t i o nf o rp h o t o n sp r o p g a t i n gi nag i v e n direction \u02c6p.T h e q u a n t i t y\u00b5 is the cosine of the angle between the wavevectork and the photon propagation direction \u02c6p, R 3 b 4 r , and we have simpli\ufb01ed the equation by assuming that Thomson scattering is isotropic. The time derivatives here are with respect to the conformal time de\ufb01ned byd dt a t . The quantities and are new, and result from treating the situation in GR. Basically, two perturbations to the metric describe the e ect of weak gravitational \ufb01elds resulting from the \ufb02uctuations for so called scalar peturbations, where corresponds to what we usually think of as the Newtonian gravitational potential, and corresponds to a perturbation of the spatial curvature.

The \ufb01rst two terms on the right hand side are the time dilation and gravitational redshift e ects that give rise to the Sachs Wolfe e ect, and describe the change in the energy of the photons as they propagate through a perturbed spactime. The last term on the right hand side repre sents the redistribution of photons by Thomson scattering, which brings in the optical depth, ,a n di n c l u d e saD o p p l e rb o o s tf r o mt h ev e l o c i t yo ft h eb a r y o n\ufb02 u i d .T h es e c o n de q u a t i o n is the force equation for the baryon velocity, which we knew as the Euler equation in the Newtonian analysis.

The wavevectork sets a natural polar axis, and the temperature anisotropy corresponds to knowing the photon phase space distribution at our location in space, that is, the distribution of the photons in energy and as a function of angle with respect tok.E v o l v i n g t h i s f u n c t i o n i s h a r d p r i n c i p a l l y because of the coupling between radiation and matter set by Thomson scattering.

In fact, it is clear that the force must be proportional to the dipole monent of the distribution function which is the origin of the 1 in the equation above. This creates an obvious problem it couples the evolution of the number of photons traveling in a given direction\u02c6p with knowledge of the whole distribution. Mathematically, we have an integro di erential equation. In practice, rather than trying to numerically solve for the photon distribution function normally denoted by , we can carry out a multipole transform to work with .T h e integro di erential equation then becomes a set of equations that couple di erent values. These have to be solved as a large set of equations since the CMB power spectrum contains signal extending beyond 1000 , and when this is done we will have to integrate overk space. It took many years to solve this numerical challenge, and even then the computations were very slow. A key development in cosmology was the development of CMBFAST in 1996 by Seljak and Zaldarriaga, who \ufb01gured out a trick to perform the required Boltzmann equation integrations much faster than was previously possible. Their public release of this code allowed computation of the CMB angular power spectrum su ciently rapidly that a large range of models could be investigated by non specialists. We discussed these Boltzmann solvers previously when we discussed transfer functions in linear structure formation. There 21 are now other codes that supercede CMBFAST in accuracy and ease of use like CMBEASY, CAMB, CLASS, and PyCosmo. 22 48 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN FEBRUARY 2004 BRYAN CHRISTIE DESIGN COSMIC HARMONICS THE SOUND SPECTRUM of the early universe had overtones much like a musical instrument s. If you blow into a pipe, the sound corresponds to a wave with maximum air compression blue at the mouthpiece and maximum rarefaction red at the end piece. But the sound also has a series of overtones with shorter wavelengths that are integer fractions of the fundamental wavelength. The wavelengths of the first, second and third overtones are one half, one third and one fourth as long. SOUND WAVES also oscillated in the plasma of the early universe. After inflation, the fundamental wave compressed some regions of plasma and rarefied others, causing the temperature of the CMB radiation in the regions to reach maximum blue and minimum red values by the time of recombination. The overtones oscillated two, three or more times as quickly, causing smaller regions to reach maximum and minimum CMB temperatures at the time of recombination.
