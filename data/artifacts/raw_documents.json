                "Content": "Phys 236: Cosmology\nLecture 2: The Robertson Walker Metric\nThe \ufb01rst key observation in modern cosmology was the discovery of the expanding universe\nby Edwin Hubbble. By 1929 he had obtained Cepheid distances for 24 galaxies with red-\nshifts and claimed that these displayed a linear relationship: v = Hd. He cited theoretical\npredictions from relativistic cosmology that redshift or velocity should increase linearly with\ndistance in an expanding Universe as a possible explanation. At the time, Hubble estimated\nH \u2243500 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121, because his calibration of Cepheid luminosities was in error. The\nbest modern value is close to 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121. In this and the following few lectures we will\nwork out the mathematical description of expanding spacetime that leads to Hubbble\u2019s law.\n1 Hubble Expansion and Scale Factor a(t)\nFigure 1: Expansion of the Universe. The comoving distance between points on an imag-\ninary coordinate grid remains constant as the universe expands. The physical distance is\nproportional to the comoving distance times the scale factor a(t) and hence increases with\ntime. Figure from Baumann.\nNow we begin to mathematically codify the idea of an expanding Universe. Consider a\ndistribution of galaxies that is made to expand uniformly, in the same way as if a picture of\nthe pattern was undergoing continuous magni\ufb01cation as illustrated in Fig. 1. Mathematically,\nthis means that all position vectors at time t are just scaled versions of their values at a\nreference time t0:\nx(t) = a(t)x(t0). (1)\nDi\ufb00erentiating this with respect to t gives\n\u02d9x(t) = \u02d9a(t)x(t0) = [\u02d9a(t)/a(t)]x(t), (2)\nor a velocity proportional to distance, as required. Writing this relation for two points 1 and\n2 and subtracting, shows that this expansion appears the same for any choice of origin \u2014\n1\neveryone is the center of the universe:\n[ \u02d9x2(t) \u2212\u02d9x1(t)] = H(t)[x2(t) \u2212x1(t)]; H(t) \u2261\u02d9a/a. (3)\nThis shows that the Hubble constant can be identi\ufb01ed with \u02d9a/a, and that in general it is not\na constant, but something that can change with time.\n2 The Robsertson-Walker Metric\n2.1 Assumptions\nThe standard model in cosmology is the nearly homogeneous and isotropic expansion of the\nUniverse, according to the theory of General Relativity, that ultimately traces back to a hot\nBig Bang. To describe the Universe as a whole we make no attempts to incorporate discrete\nstructures like galaxies or clusters. We imagine all matter in the Universe smeared out into\nan idealized, smooth \ufb02uid that de\ufb01nes the overall kinematics of the system of galaxies.\nThe mathematical framework for the standard model is based on theCosmological Princi-\nple, which is the hypothesis that, on su\ufb03ciently large scales1 the Universe can be considered\nspatially homogeneous and isotropic. Philosophically this can be thought of as a generaliza-\ntion of the Copernican Principle , that there is nothing special or priveleged about our\nplace in the universe. The cosmological principle can also be stated as the existence of a\nfundamental observer at each location, to whom the Universe appears isotropic. The\nconcept of a fundamental observer is required because two observers at the same point, but\nin relative motion, cannot both see the surrounding Universe as isotropic. The fundamental\nobserver thus implies a cosmological \u2018rest frame\u2019 at each location in space and this rest frame\nis de\ufb01ned to be one that is comoving with the Universe\u2019s global expansion, or being \u201cin the\nHubble \ufb02ow\u201d.\nMore speci\ufb01cally, imagine the expanding universe \ufb01lled with fundamental observers each at\ndi\ufb00erent locations, all of whom are at rest with respect to the matter in their vicinity. We\ncan envisage them as each sitting on a di\ufb00erent galaxy, and so receding from each other\nwith the general Hubble expansion. Actually this is not quite right, since each galaxy has\na peculiar velocity with respect to its neighbors of a few hundred km s \u22121 which are sourced\nby density \ufb02uctuations. We really need to imagine an idealized universe where the matter\ndensity is uniform. The fundamental observers give us a way of de\ufb01ning a universal time\ncoordinate, even though relativity tells us that such a thing is impossible in general. We can\nde\ufb01ne a cosmological time t, which is the time measured by the clocks of these observers \u2013\ni.e. t is the proper time measured by an observer at rest with respect to the local matter\ndistribution and hence comoving with the expansion of the Universe.\nA nice concrete example of this idea of a fundamental observer at work occurs in analysis\nof the CMB. The most prominent CMB anisotropy is actually a yin-yang dipole pattern of\nredshifted and blueshifted photons that is induced by the motion of the solar system in the\nMilky Way and the peculiar velocity of the Milky Way and local group of galaxies relative\n1Practically speaking this length scale is around 100 Mpc\n2\nto a fundamental observer comoving with the Hubble \ufb02ow.\n2.2 The Robertson-Walker Metric\nIn GR, the presence of massive bodies simply a\ufb00ects the geometry of four dimensional\nspacetime. At every point in spacetime there is a metric \u2013 a geometry \u2013 that is determined\nby the gravitational \ufb01eld at that point. Given a geometry, we can calculate the equations of\nmotion. It was shown in 1935 by Robertson & Walker that the assumption of homogeneity\nand isotropy requires the metric to take the form, in spherical polar coordinates,\nds2 = \u2212c2dt2 + a2(t)\n[\ndr2 + S2\nk(r)(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62)\n]\n= \u2212c2dt2 + a2(t)\n[\ndr2 + S2\nk(r)d\u21262]\n, (4)\nwhere\nSk(r) =\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\nR0 sin(r/R0) k= +1\nr k = 0\nR0 sinh(r/R0) k= \u22121\n(5)\nThis is known as the Robertson-Walker (RW) metric (or the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\nmetric). Here a(t) is the scale factor introduced in \u00a7 1 which determines the overall scale of\nthe spatial part of the metric and thus describes how distances expand or contract with time.\nThe quantity k = +1, 0, or \u22121 is the curvature constant, and d\u21262 = d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 is\nthe familiar solid angle from spherical coordinates, and r is a time\u2013independent (comoving)\nradial coordinate \u2192comoving observers have the same r at all times, even if the Universe\nexpands or contracts. The quantity R0 is the radius of curvature of the universe at the\npresent epoch.\nThe quantity ds2 is an invariant interval between two neighboring events in spacetime sep-\narated by dx\u00b5, ( \u00b5 = 0 ,1,2,3). In the language of GR this interval ds2 can be written\nas\nds2 =\n\u2211\n\u00b5\u03bd\ng\u00b5\u03bddx\u00b5dx\u03bd, (6)\nwhere g\u00b5\u03bd is the metric tensor (a symmetric N\u00d7N matrix, where N = 4 is the dimension\nof the spacetime), which expresses the notion of distance between spacetime points. The\nmetric determines the trajectories of free-falling bodies (they move along geodesics of the\nspacetime) and also how light propagates in curved space (light travels along so-called null\ngeodesics) with ds2 = 0. The indices \u00b5 and \u03bd run over the time coordinate (labelled \u201c0\u201d)\nand the 3 space coordinates. In general, g\u00b5\u03bd will be a complicated function of space and time\nwith o\ufb00-diagonal terms that make the separation of space and time impossible. However,\nthe metric tensor simpli\ufb01es enormously when space is homogeneous and isotropic.\nFinally, note that the coordinate system used above is not the only possibility. For example\nif we peform a change of varaibles \u03c1= Sk(r), the metric for a homogenous, isotropic, three-\ndimensional space can be written\nds2 = \u2212c2dt2 + a2(t)\n[ d\u03c12\n1 \u2212k(\u03c1/R0)2 + \u03c12d\u21262\n]\n. (7)\n3\nwhich has the advantage that the \u03c12d\u21262 terms looks like what one gets in spherical coordi-\nnates for Euclidean (i.e. \ufb02at) space.\n2.3 Building Intuition For Metrics\nWhether we use the term or not, we are all familiar with metrics. For example, using the\nPythagorean theorem we can write the distance between two points in ordinary 3D space as\ns2 = x2 + y2 + z2, (8)\nwhich de\ufb01nes the so\u2013called Euclidean metric. In the special theory of relativity this becomes\ngeneralized to the distance between two spacetime points:\ns2 = \u2212(ct)2 + x2 + y2 + z2. (9)\nWe can write the in\ufb01nitesimal version of this as\nds2 =\n\u2211\n\u00b5\u03bd\n\u03b7\u00b5\u03bddx\u00b5dx\u03bd, (10)\nwhere the only nonzero components of the metric tensor are the diagonal terms ( \u22121,1,1,1)\n(Minkowski spacetime), and where it is understood that dx0 = cdt. If the two events are\nconnected by a signal travelling at v, such that dxi = vidt then\nds2 = \u2212c2dt2\n(\n1 \u2212v2\nc2\n)\n. (11)\nA light pulse expands in a sphere at the speed of light, so v = c and thus it travels along a\nnull geodesic with ds2 = 0, such that the events can be connected by a light-ray.\nIn spherical coordinates\nx = rsin \u03b8cos \u03c6\ny = rsin \u03b8sin \u03c6\nz = rcos \u03b8, (12)\nwhere r is the radial coordinate, \u03b8 is the polar angle, and \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle\nds2 = \u2212c2dt2 + dr2 + r2(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62). (13)\nThus the coordinate system changed but the metric still describes \ufb02at space.\nIn contrast, consider the surface of a 2D sphere of radius R embedded in a \ufb02at 3D space.\nThe spatial part of the metric would then be\nds2 = R2(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62). (14)\nIt is easy to show that this represents a closed surface with \ufb01nite area and no boundary. We\n4\nFigure 2: Examples of di\ufb00erent spacetime ge-\nometries described by the FRW metric. In\nwhite is an equilateral triangle. Black arrows\nindicate how initially parallel geodesics will\nbehave. Top: Flat Space. The angles of a\ntriangle drawn on this plane add up to exactly\n180 degrees. If the Universe has zero curva-\nture, then its geometry is the ordinary 3D Eu-\nclidean space that we are most familiar with.\nMiddle: The surface of a sphere is \ufb01nite, but\nit doesn\u2019t have an edge. The angles of a spher-\nical triangle add up to more than 180 degrees.\nIf the Universe has positive curvature, then\nits geometry is the 3D analogue of a sphere.\nBottom: The surface of a saddle. The angles\nof a triangle drawn on this saddle add up to\nless than 180 degrees. If the Universe has neg-\native curvature, then its geometry is the 3D\nanalogue of an in\ufb01nite saddle.\ncan introduce a new radial coordinate r= Rsin \u03b8, then\ndr\nR = cos \u03b8d\u03b8 =\n[\n1 \u2212\n(r\nR\n)2]1/2\nd\u03b8, (15)\nand the line element in eqn. (14) can be rewritten as\nds2 = dr2\n1 \u2212(r/R)2 + r2d\u03c62. (16)\nNow note that this metric has the exact same form as the spatial part of the Robertson\u2013\nWalker metric in eqn. (7) (modulo the scale factor a2), provided that we identify d\u03c62 = d\u21262,\ntake k = +1, and identify R, the radius of our sphere, with the radius of curvature R0\ndiscussed previously. Whereas the equation above is for a 2D spherical surface (which we\ncan visualize as being embedded in 3-space), eqn. (4) actually corresponds to a 3D spherical\nvolume which, just like the 2D sphere, is spatially closed and has a \ufb01nite volume with no\nboundary.\nIt is possible to convert this to the metric for the 2D analog of a constant negative curvature\nsurface by considering an imaginary radius of curvature R \u2192iR. In this case k = \u22121 and\nthe metric takes the form\nds2 = dr2\n1 + (r/R)2 + r2d\u03c62. (17)\n5\nHilbert proved that a two-dimensional surface of uniform negative curvature cannot be em-\nbedded in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, so this is not something you can easily\nvisualize. Maybe that is not so surprising, since the hyperbolic space described by this\nmetric has in\ufb01nite area.\nThe saddle shape illustrated in Fig 2 has uniform negative curvature only in the central\nregion, near the \u201cseat\u201d of the saddle.\nFinally, the Euclidean case of zero curvature is the case k = 0 which you can think of as\nthe limit where the radius of curvature R \u2192\u221e. As we will see observations indicate that\nk = 0 to very high precision, so for the purposes of this course we will work primarily with\nthe Euclidean case.\n3 Proper Distance, Redshift, and Hubble Drag\n3.1 Proper Distance\nConsider a galaxy su\ufb03ciently far away from us that that we can consider the Universe as\nuniform on this scale and thus well described by the RW metric. In an expanding universe,\nthe distance between two objects is increasing with time as illustrated by the simple example\nin \u00a7 1. The proper distance rp between two points is equal to the length of the spacelike\ngeodesic (a geodesic with dt= 0) between them at some instant in cosmic time t, such that\nwe can consider dt= 0 and the scale factor to be \ufb01xed at the value a(t), which implies\nds2 = a2(t)dr2 =\u21d2 ds= a(t)dr (18)\nwhere we have assumed the angle ( \u03b8,\u03c6) is equal to a constant along this geodesic such that\nd\u21262 = 0.\nThe proper distance rp is obtained by integrating over the radial comoving coordinate r:\nrp(t) = a(t)\n\u222b r\n0\ndr= a(t)r. (19)\nThus the proper distance rp(t) is a function of time but the comoving distance r is not. You\ncan think of the comoving distance as being distance measured in units of the grid cells in\nFig. 1. Although the proper length of the cell-side expands with time, distances in units of\nthese cells are constant. The rate of change of proper distance between any two points is\nvp(t) = \u02d9rp(t) = \u02d9a(t)r= \u02d9a\narp = H(t)rp, (20)\nwhere we have used the time dependent Hubble expanstion rate H(t) = \u02d9a/a. The equation\nabove implies that at any time t there is a linear relation between the proper distance to\na galaxy and its recession speed which is referred to as the Hubble \ufb02ow. At the present\ntime t = t0 we de\ufb01ne H(t0) \u2261 H0, which has the observationally determined value of\n68 \u00b12 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121. Again this idea of a constant comoving distance r, the scale factor\na(t), and the resulting linear relation between velocity vp and proper distance rp are just\n6\nrepetitions of the discussion in \u00a7 1 of the expanding picture pattern, but now expressed more\nformally in terms of the metric.\n3.2 Light Propagation and Redshift\nTo analyse the observations of light from distant objects we need to account for the fact that\nthe wavelength of the light gets stretched (or, equivalently, the photons lose energy) due to\nthe expansion of the universe, which is known as redshift. We can work out how redshift\nrelates to a(t). Let us consider the time it takes light to travel along a null geodesic with\nds2 = 0. Suppose the light is emitted at t= tem at position rand travels to position 0 where\nit arrives at time t = tobs. Note that because of isotropy and homogeneity we can always\nchoose to orient our coordinate system so that \u03b8and \u03c6will be constant. Since photons travel\nalong null geodesics with ds2 = 0 we have:\ncdt\na(t) = \u2212dr =\u21d2\n\u222b tobs\ntem\ncdt\na(t) = \u2212\n\u222b 0\nr\ndr= r. (21)\nNow let us also consider a second signal emitted just slightly later at tem +\u2206tem and received\nat tobs + \u2206tobs:\nr =\n\u222b tobs+\u2206tobs\ntem+\u2206tem\ncdt\na(t),\n=\n\u222b tobs\ntem\ncdt\na(t) \u2212\n\u222b tem+\u2206tem\ntem\ncdt\na(t) +\n\u222b tobs+\u2206tobs\ntobs\ncdt\na(t)\n\u2248\n\u222b tobs\ntem\ncdt\na(t) \u2212c\u2206tem\na(tem) + c\u2206tobs\na(tobs). (22)\nSince r is a comoving coordinate which by construction has not changed with time, both\neqn. (21) and eqn. (22) are equal to r. This implies that\n\u2206tobs = a(tobs)\na(tem) \u2206tem.\nNow imagine that the time interval we considered \u2206tem to be at di\ufb00erent crests of an electro-\nmagnetic wave so that \u2206tem can be identi\ufb01ed with the period Tem = 1/\u03bdem = \u03bbem/c. We can\nalso choose tobs to be the present day so that the scale factor a(tobs) = 1, which is how we\ngenerally normalize the scale factor at the present epoch. The previous equation can then\nbe rewritten as\n\u03bbobs = a(tem)\u22121\u03bbem = (1 + z)\u03bbem (23)\nwhere we have de\ufb01ned a(tem) \u22611/(1 +z). The expansion of the Universe implies light must\nredshift!\n7\n3.3 Peculiar Velocity and Hubble Drag\nAs we will see later, small perturbations in the background energy density distribution cause\nthe growth of structures, which in turn induce velocities that deviate from pure expansion.\nThese velocities with respect to the cosmological rest frame of the fundamental observers\nare called peculiar velocities.\nThe proper velocity with respect to a fundamental observer at the origin is vp = drp/dt,\nwhere\nvp = drp\ndt = d\ndt(a(t)r(t)) = \u02d9a(t)r(t) + a(t)\u02d9r(t) = vexp + vpec (24)\nwhere we have used eqn. (19) for rp and the comoving distance r(t) is now a function of\ntime beacuse of the presence of a peculiar velocity, such that \u02d9r(t) is the comoving peculiar\nvelocity and a(t)\u02d9r(t) converts this to a proper peculiar velocity vpec.\nXtime = t\n!observer\nVpec(t) Xtime = t + dt\n!d\u2113 Vpec(t+dt)\nFigure 3: A particle X with peculiar velocity vpec observed by an observer Oat two di\ufb00erent\ntimes, t and t= t+ dt.\nNow imagine that there is a particle which is moving with a proper peculiar velocity vpec.\nIt will gradually overtake objects in the Hubble \ufb02ow owing to its peculiar velocity, but since\nin an expanding universe objects at larger distances are moving faster because of the the\nuniversal expansion, its peculiar velocity will appear to decelerate from the perspective of a\nfundamental observer who is in the Hubble \ufb02ow.\nTo be more precise consider the diagram in Fig. 3. A fundamental observer Oobserves a\nparticle X traveling with peculiar velocity vpec(t). An in\ufb01tesimal interval dt of time later\nat time t+ dt the particle X has traveled to a new location d\u2113 away from Oand has a new\npeculiar velocity vpec(t+ dt). The quesiton we aim to answer is how does vpec(t) change\nwith time?\nTo answer this consider that from the perspective ofO, the particle P has no forces acting on\nit, and because special relativity applies over these in\ufb01testimal intervals we are considering,\n8\nP cannot have been accelerated, and since the proper velocities are physical velocities we\nmust have vp(t) = vp(t+ dt) where vp is the proper velocity measured by O.\nAt time t\nvp(t) = vpec(t), (25)\nsince there is no expansion contribution since Ois a fundamental observer moving with the\nHubble \ufb02ow and r(t) = 0 (the comoving separation between the particle X and O) at t= 0.\nWhereas at time t+ dt\nvp(t+dt) = vexp(t+dt)+vpec(t+dt) = H(t+dt)d\u2113+vpec(t+dt) \u2248H(t)vpec(t)dt+vpec(t+dt).\n(26)\nHere we have written the expansion term in terms of the Hubble constant, and in the last\napproximation we have used d\u2113 = vpec(t)dt and Taylor expanded working only to linear\norder in small quantities. Equating vp(t) = vp(t+ dt), we \ufb01nd\nvpec(t+ dt) \u2212vpec = \u2212H(t)vpec(t)dt (27)\nor dvpec\ndt = \u2212Hvpec. (28)\nThus we see that from the perspective of O, the peculiar velocity of particle X decreases\nwith time, which is known as Hubble drag.\nWe can rearrange this equation slightly to obtain\ndvpec\ndt = dvpec\nda \u02d9a= \u2212\u02d9a\navpec \u2192dvpec\nda = \u22121\navpec. (29)\nTaking the dot product of the equation above with vpec one obtains\ndvpec\nda \u00b7vpec = 1\n2\ndv2\npec\nda = \u22121\nav2\npec \u2192dv2\npec\nv2\npec\n= \u22122da\na (30)\nIt is easy to show that this implies\nln(vpec/vpec,0) = \u2212ln(a/a0) (31)\nor\nvpec \u221da\u22121. (32)\nOne can also show that the relativistic generalization of this is that p\u221da\u22121 where p is the\nmomentum. For a particle moving at v = c, we already derived this...it\u2019s called redshift!\nIn other words, since photon momentum depends on wavelength, p = h/\u03bb, the redshifting\nof light as the Universe expands \u03bb \u221da implies the same p \u221da\u22121 reduction in momentum.\nWhereas our prevous deriviation of the redshift treated light as an electromagnetic wave\nwith crests and troughs, this derivation in terms of momentum also applies to the quantum\nmechanical treatment of light as photons.\n9\n4 Horizons\nThe size of a causally connected patch of space is determined by how far light can travel\nin a certain amount of time. As we mentioned previously in \u00a7 3.2, light travels along null\ngeodesics with ds2 = 0 and we have from the FRW metric\ncdt\na(t) = dr, (33)\nwhere t is cosmic time, r is the comoving distance, and we orient our coordinate system to\nhave d\u21262 = 0. In this context it is convenient to make a change of variables which de\ufb01nes\nthe conformal time\nd\u03c4 = dt\na(t). (34)\nIntegrating both sides, we see that along a null geodesic one then has\n\u2206r= \u00b1c\u2206\u03c4, (35)\nwhere the plus sign corresponds to outgoing photons and the minus sign to incoming photons.\nThe advantage of the conformal time is that in these coordinates the propagation of light in\nthe FRW metric looks the same as it does in Minkowski space c\u2206t= \u2206x, namely light rays\ntravel along straight lines at 45\u25e6 angles in r\u2212\u03c4 coordinates (assuming c= 1 as is customary\nin relativity), whereas had we used the cosmic time t the light cones in a curved spacetime\nwould be curved.\nWe are now in a position to de\ufb01ne two di\ufb00erent types of cosmological horizons. One which\nlimits the distances at which past events can be observed and another which limits the\ndistances at which it will ever be possible to in\ufb02uence events in the future. Because signals\ncannot travel faster than the speed of light, these horizons then also determine the sizes of\ncausally connected regions of spacetime.\n4.1 Particle Horizon\nAccording to eqn. (35), the maximum comoving distance that light can travel between two\nconformal times \u03c41 and \u03c42 >\u03c41 is simply \u2206r= c\u2206\u03c4. Hence if the Big Bang \u2018started\u2019 with a\nsingularity at ti \u22610, then the largest comoving distance from which an observer at time t\nwill be able to receive a signal traveling at the speed of light is given by\nrph(\u03c4) = c(\u03c4 \u2212\u03c4i) =\n\u222b t\nti\ncdt\na(t), (36)\nwhich is known as the comoving particle horizon . The size of the particle horizon at\ntime \u03c4 can be visualised by the intersection of the past light cone of an observer p with the\nspacelike hypersurface (i.e. constant time) \u03c4 = \u03c4i, which corresponds to the Big Bang as\nillustrated in Figure 4. Notice that the Big Bang singularity is a moment in time, but not\na point in space, which explains why we illustrate the singularity by an extended (possibly\nin\ufb01nite) spacelike hypersurface in Figure 4. Causal in\ufb02uences have to come from within this\n10\nregion. Only comoving particles whose worldlines intersect the past light cone of pcan send\na signal to an observer at p. The boundary of the region containing such worldlines is the\nparticle horizon at p. Notice that every observer has his or her own particle horizon.\n4.2 Event Horizon\nJust as there are past events that we cannot see now, there may be regions of space in the\nfuture that we will never be able to in\ufb02uence. In comoving coordinates, the largest distance\nfrom which an observer at some future time tf will receive signals emitted at any time later\nthan an earlier time t is given by\nreh(\u03c4) = c(\u03c4f \u2212\u03c4) =\n\u222b tf\nt\ncdt\na(t), (37)\nwhich is called the comoving event horizon. It is conceptually similar to the event horizon\nof black holes in that it de\ufb01nes a maximum distance out to which a signal can ever travel.\nHere, \u03c4f denotes the \u2018\ufb01nal moment of conformal time\u2019. Notice that \u03c4f may be \ufb01nite even if\nthe \ufb01nal moment of physical time is in\ufb01nite tf = +\u221e. Indeed, whether or not this is the\ncase depends on the form of a(t). In particular, \u03c4f is \ufb01nite for our universe if dark energy is\nreally a cosomological constant.\n11\nFigure 4: Spacetime diagram illustrating the concept of horizons. The x-axis is comoving\ndistance and the y-axis is conformal time. Dotted lines show the worldlines of comoving\nobjects. The particle horizon is the maximal distance from which we can receive signals.\nThus the shaded region indicates regions of spacetime that are causally connected to us.\nThe event horizon is the maximal distance to which we can send a signal. The speed of light\nis assumed to be unity in this diagram such that light travels along world lines oriented at\na 45\u25e6 angle.\n12\nFigure 5: Light cone in x, y, t-space. An event which is at the origin x= y= 0 at the present\ntime t0 will follow some world line into the future, always remaining inside the future light\ncone. All points on the world line are at timelike locations with respect to the spatial origin\nat t0. World lines for light signals emitted from (received at) the origin at t0 will propagate\non the envelope of the future (past) light cone. No signals can be sent to or received from\nspacelike locations. The space in the past from which signals can be received at the present\norigin is restricted by the particle horizon at tmin, the earliest time under consideration. The\nevent horizon restricts the space which can at present be in causal relation to the present\nspatial origin at some future time tmax. Figure from Roos.\n13"

Einstein\u2019s \ufb01eld equation plays a role in\ngeneral relativity that is analogous to Poisson\u2019s equation in Newtonian dynamics. Poisson\u2019s\nequation,\n\u22072\u03a6 = 4\u03c0G\u03c1, (1)\ntells you how to compute the gravitational potential \u03a6 given the mass density\u03c1. Analogously,\nEinstein\u2019s \ufb01eld equation is\nG\u00b5\u03bd = 8\u03c0G\nc4 T\u00b5\u03bd, (2)\nwhere G\u00b5\u03bd is the Einstein tensor, which is a 4 \u00d74 symmetric tensor which depends on\nderivatives of the metricg\u00b5\u03bd, and T\u00b5\u03bd is the stress-energy tensor, sometimes also called the\nenergy-momentum tensor, which quanti\ufb01es the density of energy and momentum and how\nthey \ufb02ow. The tensors are symmetric, so the result is ten nonlinear second-order di\ufb00erential\nequations. Given the stress energy tensor, one can solve the \ufb01eld equation for the metric g\u00b5\u03bd\ndetermining how mass-energy tells space how to curve. Armed with the metric one can then\ndetermine particle trajectories via the geodesic equation , which depends on derivatives\nof the metric. Spacetime thus tells mass-energy how to move, and the geodesic equation is\nthe analog of taking the gradient of the gravitational potential to determine the Newtonian\nforce on a particle.\nSolutions to the Einsten \ufb01eld equation can be extremely complicated. However, in the\ncosmological context the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy dramatically simplify the\nproblem. Recall the RW metric\nds2 = \u2212c2dt2 + a2(t)\n[\ndr2 + Sk(r)d\u21262]\n, (3)\nwhere\nSk(r) =\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\nR0 sin(r/R0) k= +1\nr k = 0\nR0 sinh(r/R0) k= \u22121.\n(4)\nSo for our present purposes, we need to understand how the energy denstiy \u03c1 and pressure\nP of the material in the universe determine the scale factor a(t), the curvature constant k,\nand R0 the radius of curvature at the present epoch.\n1 The Friedmann Equation\nThe equation of motion for the scale factor a(t) known as the Friedmann equation can be\nderived in a quasi-Newtonian fashion. The cosmological principle states that the the Universe\nis homogeneous and isotropic when aveaged over su\ufb03ciently large scales. It thus follows that\nits global properties (such as density and pressure) at any time must be the same as those in\n1\nsome volume su\ufb03ciently small 1 that Newtonian physics is valid (but su\ufb03ciently large that\nhomogeneity and isotropy still hold). Consider such a small spherical region of \ufb01xed mass\nM enclosed within radius R. Homogeneity and isotropy imply that the acceleration of a test\nparticle at R should obey\n\u00a8R= \u2212GM\nR2 , (5)\nNote that, because of the homogeneity, there is no force due to pressure gradients and that\nonly the mass within the sphere is relevant for the dynamics of R. This follows directly\nfrom Birkho\ufb00\u2019s theorem, according to which the gravitational acceleration at any radius in\na spherically symmetric system depends only on the mass within that radius.\nWe can multiply each side of this equation by \u02d9R and integrate once to obtain\n1\n2\n\u02d9R2 \u2212GM\nR = E. (6)\nHere E is a constant of integration which equals the energy per unit mass of a test particle at\nR. Now using the fact that the mass of the sphere is a constant equal to M = 4\u03c0\u03c1(t)R(t)3/3,\nwhere \u03c1(t) is the mass density, we can rewrite the equation above as\n1\n2\n\u02d9R2 \u22124\u03c0G\u03c1R2\n3 = E, (7)\nIf we now de\ufb01ne R= a(t)R0, where R0 is independent of t, it then follows\nH2(t) =\n(\u02d9a\na\n)2\n= 8\u03c0G\u03c1\n3 \u2212 kc2\nR2\n0a2 , (8)\nwhere wave have introduced a new integration constant, k = \u22122E/c2, to be identi\ufb01ed with\nthe curvature constant in the RW metric in eqn. (4).\nThe equation above is known as theFriedmann equationand is one of the two fundamental\nequations describing the expansion of the universe. Although we derived it classically, its\nform is identical to the equation resulting from the proper treatment of GR. There are\nhowever two important di\ufb00erences that only a full relativistic treatment can elucidate.\nFirst, the fully relativistic version of eqn. (5) for the acceleration from which we derived the\nFriedmann equation is\n\u00a8R= \u22124\u03c0G\n3 R\n(\n\u03c1+ 3P\nc2\n)\n, (9)\nwhich encodes the fact that in GR pressure gravitates and the active energy density that\nsources gravity is now \u03c1+ 3P/c2. This equation for the acceleration and the Friedmann\nequation (eqn. 8) in fact arise as independent equations from di\ufb00erent components of the\nEinstein equation. The Friedmann equation turns out to be identical to our classical result\nprovided that \u03c1 is taken as the energy density of anything, i.e. mass energy, radiation,\n1By small here we mean relative to the Hubble radiuscH\u22121\n0 and if the universe is curvedk \u0338= 0 then also\nto the radius of curvatureR0 \u223ccH\u22121\n0 .\n2\nor vacuum energy (note that following convention, we write \u03c1 as a mass density which is\ne\ufb00ectively the energy density divided by c2). But this dependence on pressure implies that\none needs one more piece of information in order to solve for the universe\u2019s dynamics, namely\nthe equation of state of each energy component P(\u03c1) which we will come to next.\nThe second di\ufb00erence between the classical treatment and GR is that classically the energy\nE and radius R0 of this shell are arbitrary initial conditions at t = 0. Whereas in the full\nderivation from GR the curvature constant k is uniquely determined to be k= +1, \u22121, or 0\nand R0 is the radius of curvature of the universe (if k\u0338= 0), both of which are determined by\nthe mass energy contents of the universe. This profound connection between the geometry\nof the universe and its energy contents cannot be fully captured classically.\nTo understand the physical implications of this relationship between geometry and mass-\nenergy it helps to de\ufb01ne the critical density \u03c1c and the density parameter \u2126( t)\n\u03c1c(t) \u22613H2(t)\n8\u03c0G and \u2126( t) = \u03c1\n\u03c1c\n(10)\nsuch that the Friedmann equation (eqn. (8)), can be written\n1 \u2212\u2126(t) = \u2212 kc2\nR2\n0a2(t)H2(t) (11)\nwhich can be rearranged\nk= [\u2126(t) \u22121]\n(R0a2(t)\ncH\u22121(t)\n)2\n. (12)\nIn this form, one more clearly sees how the curvature is related to the energy contents. There\nare three possibilities that can be distinguished provided one can measure the value of \u2126( t)\nat any time:\n\u2022spatially open: if at any time \u2126( t) <1 then this implies k <0 and the universe has\nnegative curvature (hyperbolic geometry).\n\u2022spatially closed: if at any time \u2126( t) > 1 then this implies k >0 and the universe\nhas positive curvature (spherical geometry).\n\u2022spatially \ufb02at: if at any time \u2126(t) = 1 then this implies k= 0 and the universe is \ufb02at\nand the geometry is Euclidean.\nThe current best constraints on \u2126 0 = \u2126( t = t0) come from the combining the Planck\nCMB measurements with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements. They indicate that\nthe universe is conistent with being spatially \ufb02at to very high precision \u2126 0 = 0.999 \u00b10.002.\nSo for the rest of this course we will always assume k = 0 implying that the geometry is\nEuclidean and allowing us to use the simplest form of the RW metric where Sk(r) = r.\n3\n2 The Fluid Equation\nWe argued that the Friedmann equation encapsulates the idea of energy conservation \u2014 that\nis the gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy of expansion must equal a constant.\nLet\u2019s consider another classical manifestation of energy conservation which is the \ufb01rst law\nof thermodynamics\ndQ= TdS = dU + PdV, (13)\nwhere dQ is the heat \ufb02ow into or out of a volume V, dU is the change in internal energy,\nP is the pressure and dV is the change in volume. Homogeneity requires that there is no\nbulk \ufb02ow of heat dQ = 0, which is to say that the expansion of the universe is adiabatic.\nDividing the equation above by dt implies\n\u02d9U + P \u02d9V = 0. (14)\nConsider a sphere of comoving radius rc expanding with the universal Hubble expansion, its\nproper radius will be rp = a(t)rc, and the proper volume of this sphere to which the \ufb01rst law\nof thermodynamics should apply is\nV(t) = 4\u03c0\n3 r3\nca3(t); = \u21d2 \u02d9V = 4\u03c0\n3 r3\nc(3a2 \u02d9a) = V\n(\n3 \u02d9a\na\n)\n. (15)\nThe internal energy of the sphere is\nU(t) = V\u03c1(t)c2; = \u21d2 \u02d9U = c2(V \u02d9\u03c1+ \u02d9V\u03c1) = c2V\n(\n\u02d9\u03c1+ 3\u03c1\u02d9a\na\n)\n, (16)\nwhere \u03c1 is again the total mass-energy density and we used eqn. (15) for \u02d9V. Combining\neqns. (14-16) gives the \ufb01nal result\n\u02d9\u03c1+ 3 \u02d9a\na\n(\n\u03c1+ P\nc2\n)\n= 0, (17)\nwhich is known as the \ufb02uid equation or the continuity equation, and is the second key\nequation, in addition to the Friedmann equation, for describing the expansion of the Universe.\nThis important equation can also be thought of as describing \u201cenergy conservation\u201d in the\ncosmological context. Notice that the classical notion of energy conservation is expressed by\nthe continuity equation \u02d9\u03c1= \u2212\u2207\u00b7\u03c0, which states that the rate of change of energy density\nequals the negative divergence of the energy \ufb02ux \u03c0. This can be derived via Noether\u2019s\ntheorem because of symmetry under time translations. However, this symmetry is broken\nin an expanding spacetime, so the standard notion of energy conservation does not have to\nhold and is replaced by eqn. (17).\nLet\u2019s now consider what happens when we combine these two key equations, i.e. the Fried-\nmann equation in eqn. (8) and the \ufb02uid equation above. Let\u2019s start with the Friedmann\n4\nequation multiplied through by a2\n\u02d9a2 = 8\u03c0G\n3 \u03c1a2 \u2212kc2\nR2\n0\n. (18)\nTaking the time derivative yields\n2\u02d9a\u00a8a= 8\u03c0G\n3\n(\n\u02d9\u03c1a2 + 2\u03c1a\u02d9a\n)\n. (19)\nDividing by 2\u02d9aa gives\n\u00a8a\na = 4\u03c0G\n3\n(\n\u02d9\u03c1a\n\u02d9a + 2\u03c1\n)\n. (20)\nCombining with the \ufb02uid equation (eqn. 17) we \ufb01nally obtain\n\u00a8a\na = \u22124\u03c0G\n3\n(\n\u03c1+ 3P\nc2\n)\n. (21)\nwhich is the fully relativistic version of the acceleration equation (see eqn. 9), which as\nmentioned previously, indicates that pressure as well as energy are sources of gravitational\nacceleration.\n3 Equations of State and Energy Density Evolution\nTo recap, we have discussed three equations that describe the expansion of the universe:\nH2(t) = 8\u03c0G\u03c1\n3 \u2212 kc2\nR2\n0a2 Friedmann equation\n\u02d9\u03c1+ 3 \u02d9a\na\n(\n\u03c1+ P\nc2\n)\n= 0 \ufb02uid equation\n\u00a8a\na = \u22124\u03c0G\n3\n(\n\u03c1+ 3P\nc2\n)\nacceleration equation. (22)\nOnly two of these are independent since we\u2019ve just seen that we can obtain the acceleration\nequation by combining the other two. These two independent equations however depend on\nthree unknown functions a(t), \u03c1(t) and P(t), so we clearly need another equation to solve\nfor the evolution of the universe. Speci\ufb01cally, what we need is an equation of state, which\nis a relationship between the pressure P and energy density \u03c1, P(\u03c1), for whatever forms of\nenergy \ufb01ll the universe.\nIn principle there may be many di\ufb00erent sources contributing to the energy density of the\nUniverse: matter (both non-relativistic and relativistic), radiation, dark energy, scalar \ufb01elds,\netc. As we shall see later the Universe transited from a radiation dominated phase early on to\na matter dominated phase at later stages. In addition, the Universe has become dominated\nby dark energy in the recent past. We therefore focus on these three energy components and\n5\nwrite the total energy density\n\u03c1c2 = \u03c1m(c2 + \u03f5)\ued19 \ued18\ued17 \ued1a\nmatter\n+\nradiation\n\ued17 \ued1a\ued19 \ued18\n4\u03c3SB\nc T4 + \u03c1de\ued19\ued18\ued17\ued1a\ndark energy\n, (23)\nwhere the \u03c1m is the mass density, \u03f5 is the internal energy of the matter per unit mass (i.e.\n\u03f5 = 3kBTm/(2m) for a monatomic ideal gas, where kB is Boltzmann\u2019s constant, and Tm is\nthe temperature of the matter), T is the radiation \ufb01eld temperature, and \u03c1de is the dark\nenergy density.\nThe pressure associated with any of these energy components is expressed according to an\nequation of state. Becuase cosmology only deals with dilute gases the equation of state\nalways takes a simple linear form\nP = w\u03c1c2, (24)\nwhere w is a dimensionless number. Plugging this form into the \ufb02uid equation above (see\neqn. 22)\n\u02d9\u03c1+ 3 \u02d9a\na(\u03c1+ w\u03c1) = 0, (25)\nwhich can be rearranged to give\nd\u03c1\n\u03c1 = \u22123(1 + w)da\na . (26)\nProvided that w is a constant we can integrate to obtain\n\u03c1= \u03c10a\u22123(1+w), (27)\nwere \u03c10 is the energy density of some component of the energy density (i.e. matter, radiation,\ndark energy) at the present epoch (i.e. a0 = 1). Let\u2019s consider each component in slightly\nmore detail.\n3.1 Matter\nTo describe matter consider approximating the Universe as an ideal gas consisting of N\nparticles of mass m such that PmV = NkBT, \u03c1m = mN/V and hence\nPm = kBT\nm \u03c1m. (28)\nNote that w \u0338= kBT/m since \u03c1m \u0338= \u03c1. To determine w it is useful to write the equation of\nstate of the ideal gas as a function of the adibatic index \u03b3. Recall that for an ideal gas\nPm = (\u03b3\u22121)\u03c1m\u03f5 (29)\nwhere \u03f5is the internal energy per unit mass. For example for a monatomic ideal gas \u03b3 = 5/3,\n\u03f5= 3kBT/(2m), and we recover the ideal gas law above for the pressure eqn. (28).\n6\nWe can make it explicit that (in the non-relativistic limit), the rest-mass energy does not\ncontribute to the gas pressure by noting that the total energy density \u03c1c2 = \u03c1m(c2 + \u03f5) and\nrewriting the equation above as\nPm = (\u03b3\u22121)(\u03c1c2 \u2212\u03c1mc2) (30)\nCombining eqns (28) and (30) we can write\nPm = kBT\nmc2\n(\n1 + 1\n\u03b3\u22121\nkBT\nmc2\n)\u22121\n\u03c1c2, (31)\nwhich implies\nw(T) = kBT\nmc2\n(\n1 + 1\n\u03b3\u22121\nkBT\nmc2\n)\u22121\n. (32)\nSince for a non-relativistic gas kBT \u226amc2, we immediately see that w(T) \u226a1. in other\nwords a non-relativistic gas is well approximated by a \ufb02uid with zero pressure w= 0 which\nis often referred to as a dust \ufb02uid.\nSince \u03c1\u221da\u22123(1+w) a dust \ufb02uid has \u03c1\u221da\u22123 as expected. In other words, since the internal\nenergy is negligible compared to the mass-energy, it is only the dilution of the number\nof particles per proper volume that causes the mass-energy density to decrease with the\nUniverse\u2019s expansion. To understand how the Universe\u2019s expansion alters the temperature\nof this \ufb02uid we use kinetic theory which relates gas temperature to the random peculiar\nmotions of the gas particles kBT \u221dm\u27e8v2\u27e9. We learned previously that momentum and\nvelocity redshift away as v\u221da\u22121, thus we obtain T \u221da\u22122.\n3.2 Radiation\nAt early times the energy density of the universe is dominated by contributions from a hot\nplasma comprised of relativistic particles and radiation in thermal equilibrium at temperature\nT. To determine the equation of state and scalings with redshift during this period we\napproximate the energy density as arising from an ultra-relativistic \ufb02uid of particles for\nwhich\nP = \u03c1c2\n3 =\u21d2 w= 1\n3. (33)\nThis is just the familiar relationship between pressure and energy density for radiation,\nwhich an ultra-relativistic \ufb02uid must clearly approximate. It can be derived explicitly by\nwriting down the expressions for P and \u03c1 for Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics and\ncarrying out the phase-space integrals in the relativistic limit, which we will come to in a few\nlectures. We see then from eqn. (27) that for radiation \u03c1\u221da\u22124. For a black body radiation\n\ufb01eld \u03c1 \u221dT4 (see eqn. 23) which then implies that T \u221da\u22121. Note the di\ufb00erence between\nthe temperature scaling for radiation and that that for a non-relativistic ideal gas Tm \u221da\u22122\nthat we derived above.\nThis important result explains how the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation\nmaintains its blackbody form as the Universe expands. Prior to recombination the radiation\n7\nis in thermal equilibrium with the matter due to the tight coupling provided by Thompson\nscattering o\ufb00 of electrons. This black body spectrum is frozen in after recombination when\nthe opacity vanishes and photons are released. The number of photons is then simply\nconserved (not true for a true black body), and the \u03c1 \u221d a\u22124 results from the intuitive\nexplanation that the number of photons is a constant and the number density dilutes as a\u22123,\nbut the extra factor of a arises from the redshifting away of photon energy caused as the\nUniverse expands, i.e. E = h\u03bd, with \u03bd \u221da\u22121. We will derive this result more formally using\nstatistical mechanics in a few lectures.\n3.3 Dark Energy\nIn classical physics there is no way for a vacuum to have energy. But quantum \ufb01eld theory\npermits particle-antiparticle pairs to spontaneously appear and then annihilate from the\nvacuum. Just as there is an energy density associated with real particles in the Universe,\nthere is an energy density \u03c1vac associated with the virtual particle-antiparticle pairs. One can\nthen argue that the vacuum energy density \u03c1vac is a quantum-mechanical phenomenon that\nonly depends on the energy di\ufb00erence between the true and false vacua and knows nothing\nabout the expansion of the Universe and thus \u03c1vac must be independent of time. It then\nfollows from the \ufb02uid equation (eqn. 22), that for vacuum energy since\n\u03c1= \u03c10a\u22123(1+w) \u221dconst. =\u21d2 P = \u2212\u03c1c2. (34)\nThis concept of negative pressure can be di\ufb03cult to wrap your mind around. One way to\nbuild physical intuition is to recall the \ufb01rst law of thermodynamics (eqn. 14)\ndU + PdV = 0. (35)\nIf the vacuum is to have a positive energy density associated with it then expanding space\ncreates more vacuum and hence more energy. This requires that work be done\ndU + PdV = 0 = \u21d2 \u03c1vacc2dV = \u2212PvacdV =\u21d2 Pvac = \u2212\u03c1vacc2. (36)\nThis vacuum energy results in anti-gravity that causes the expansion of the Universe to\naccelerate. From the acceleration equation if Pvac = \u2212\u03c1vacc2\n\u00a8a\na = \u22124\u03c0G\n3\n(\n\u03c1+ 3P\nc2\n)\n= 8\u03c0G\n3 \u03c1vac. (37)\nMore generally we can see that, assuming an equation of state P = w\u03c1c2\n\u00a8a\na = \u22124\u03c0G\n3\n(\n\u03c1+ 3P\nc2\n)\n= \u22124\u03c0G\n3 (1 + 3w)\u03c1. (38)\nThus if w <\u22121/3 \u2192then \u00a8a> 0 and the expansion will accelerate. Any energy component\nthat satis\ufb01es this criteria for its equation of state is referred to as dark energy.\nTable 3.3 indicates how each of the mass energy components we have discussed scales with\n8\nredshift.\nTable 1: Scalings with Scale Factor of Dominant Mass-Energy Components.\nDominant components w \u03c1 P T\nmatter 0 a\u22123 a\u22125 a\u22122\nradiation 1 /3 a\u22124 a\u22124 a\u22121\nvacuum energy \u22121 a0 a0\n4 The Friedmann Equation in terms of \u2126s\nUsing what we have learned about how di\ufb00erent forms of energy (matter, radiation, vacuum\nenergy) dilute with the expansion we can rewrite the Friedmann equation\nH2(t) =\n(\u02d9a\na\n)2\n= 8\u03c0G\n3\n[\n\u03c1m,0a\u22123 + \u03c1r,0a\u22124 + \u03c1\u039b,0\n]\n\u2212 kc2\nR0a2 , (39)\nwhere zero subscripts indicate the energy density in matter, radiation, and vacuum energy\nat the present epoch t= t0 where the scale factor a(t0) = 1. Evaluating this at t= t0 then\ngives\nH2\n0 (t) = 8\u03c0G\n3 (\u03c1m,0 + \u03c1r,0 + \u03c1\u039b,0) \u2212kc2\nR0\n, (40)\nor expressing the present day total energy in terms of the critical density today\u03c1c(t0) = 3H2\n0 /\n8\u03c0G de\ufb01ned in eqn. (10)\n\u21260 = \u03c1m,0 + \u03c1r,0 + \u03c1\u039b,0\n\u03c1c(t0) = \u2126m,0 + \u2126r,0 + \u2126\u039b,0, (41)\nwhere i.e. \u2126 m,0 = \u03c1m,0/\u03c1c(t0), and so on. Then the Friedmann equation at t= t0 becomes\n\u2126k,0 \u2261\u2212 kc2\nR2\n0H2\n0\n= 1 \u2212\u21260, (42)\nand we can recast the Friedmann equation at any time t or equivalently scale factor a as\nH2(a) = H2\n0\n[\n\u2126m,0a\u22123 + \u2126r,0a\u22124 + \u2126\u039b,0 + \u2126k,0a\u22122]\n, (43)\nor\nH(z) = H0E(z), (44)\nwhere\nE(z) =\n[\n\u2126m,0a\u22123 + \u2126r,0a\u22124 + \u2126\u039b,0 + \u2126k,0a\u22122]1/2\n. (45)\nFinally, recalling the de\ufb01nition \u2126( t) = \u03c1(t)/\u03c1c(t) in eqn. (10), we can also de\ufb01ne time de-\npendent \u2126\u2019s for each component, i.e. \u2126 m(z) = \u03c1m(z)/\u03c1c(z), allowing us to also write the\n9\nFriedmann equation as\n\u2126m(z) + \u2126r(z) + \u2126\u039b(z) + \u2126k(z) = 1.

Once the expansion history is determined we can evaluate the distances and\ntime between two points, and we will see that there are many ways to do so in an expanding\nUniverse.\n1 Densities at Present\nPreviously we de\ufb01ned the density parameters of matter, radiation, and dark energy at the\npresent time relative to the critical density\n\u03c1c(t0) = 3H2\n0\n8\u03c0G = 9.2 \u00d710\u221230\n( h\n0.70\n)2\ng cm\u22123 = 1.4 \u00d71011\n( h\n0.70\n)2\nM\u2299Mpc\u22123, (1)\nsuch that \u2126m,0 = \u03c1m,0/\u03c1c,0, etc. We saw that in terms of these \u2126\u2019s the Friedmann equation\nis\nH2(z) = H2\n0\n[\n\u2126m,0a\u22123 + \u2126r,0a\u22124 + \u2126v,0 + \u2126k,0a\u22122]\n, (2)\nor\nH(z) = H0E(z), (3)\nwhere\nE(z) =\n[\n\u2126m,0a\u22123 + \u2126r,0a\u22124 + \u2126v,0 + \u2126k,0a\u22122]1/2\n. (4)\nWe then argued that since the universe is observed to be \ufb02at (k= 0) the Friedmann equation\nevaluated at the present epoch implies \u2126 k,0 = \u2212kc2/R2\n0/H2\n0 = 0 such that\n\u21260 = \u2126m,0 + \u2126r,0 + \u2126v,0 = 1 (5)\nA combination of various di\ufb00erent cosmological observations point to a benchmark model for\nwhich \u2126m,0 = 0.30 and \u2126v,0 = 0.70 and \u2126r,0 = 8.6 \u00d710\u22125. We now discuss each component\nin more detail.\n1.1 Radiation\nWhat about the radiation? Well the numbers above suggest it is negligibly small, which it is\nat the present epoch. To be more precise, we will refer to this as the relativistic component to\naccount for the fact that it can include more than just photons. The relativistic component is\ndominated by the CMB which is, to high accuracy, a black body at temperatureT\u03b3 = 2.73 K.\nA black body radiation \ufb01eld is described by the black body function, and it has an energy\ndensity\n\u03c1\u03b3c2 = 4\u03c3SBT4\nc ; \u03c3SB = \u03c02k4\nB\n60\u210f3c2 , (6)\n1\nwhere \u03c3SB is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. We will explicitly derive the expression above\nlater from statistical mechanics when we discuss thermal history. Plugging in numbers, we\nobtain\n\u03c1\u03b3,0 = 4.7 \u00d710\u221234 g cm\u22123 or \u2126\u03b3,0 \u22615.1 \u00d710\u22125. (7)\nNote that the background radiation in starlight is about an order of magnitude lower than\nthat contributed by the CMB so it can be safely neglected.\nRecall that the CMB is a relic from the time when the Universe was hot and dense enough\nto be opaque (due to Thompson scattering) to photons. If we extrapolate further back, we\nreach a time when the Universe was hot and dense enough to be opaque to neutrinos. What\nthis means is that various interactions between neutrinos, leptons, and baryons kept the\nneutrinos tightly coupled to and in thermal equilibrium with the primordial radiation bath\nthat dominates the energy density of the Universe.\nThere is thus an equivalent background of relic cosmic neutrinos which we will treat as\n\u2018radiation\u2019, since the the neutrino mass is su\ufb03ciently small m\u03bdc2 \u2272 0.1 eV that we can\nassume they are relativistic. The energy density of the cosmic neutrino background should\nbe comparable to that of the photons. We will prove this explicitly later when we discuss\nthermal history, but intuitively this makes sense if you consider that relativistic gases in\nstatsitical equilbrium ought to be in equipartition just like a non-relativistic ideal gas. We\nwill show that the cosmic neutrino background has a temperature comparable to but lower\nthan the CMB\nT\u03bd =\n(4\n11\n)1/3\nT\u03b3, (8)\nand that the corresponding energy density is\n\u03c1\u03bd = 3 \u00d77\n8 \u00d7\n(4\n11\n)4/3\n\u03c1\u03b3, (9)\nwhere the factor of 3 comes from the three left-handed neutrino \ufb02avors, the factor of 7 /8\ncomes from the fact that since neutrinos are fermions their statistical weights are slightly\ndi\ufb00erent than photons which are bosons, and the (4 /11)4/3 comes from the T4 dependence\nof the energy density and eqn. (8) for T\u03bd.\nAdding in the contribution from neutrinos, we thus \ufb01nd that\n\u03c1r,0 = 7.8 \u00d710\u221234 g cm\u22123 or \u2126 r,0 \u22618.6 \u00d710\u22125. (10)\n1.2 Matter Radiation Equality\nNow we have seen that at the present epoch \u2126r,0 \u226a\u2126m,0. However given that \u03c1m \u221da\u22123 and\n\u03c1r \u221da\u22124, there is some point in the past before which radiation dominated (see Fig. 1). We\ncan determine when this occurred by calculating the time at which\n\u03c1m,0a\u22123 = \u03c1r,0a\u22124 \u21d2 aeq \u2261 1\n1 + zeq\n= \u03c1r,0\n\u03c1m,0\n= \u2126r,0\n\u2126m,0\n(11)\n2\nwhich is known as matter-radiation equality. Plugging in numbers we \ufb01nd\n1 + zeq = 3500\n(\u2126m,0\n0.30\n)( h\n0.70\n)2\n(12)\n1.3 The Coincidence Problem\nWe can similarly ask when did the dark energy \u2126 \u039b,0 = 0.70 begin to dominate over matter\n\u2126m,0 = 0.30, since matter density scales as a\u22123 in the Friedmann equation whereas the dark\nenergy remains constant with time. This equality occurs at\n1 + zm\u039b = 1.33\n(\u2126\u039b,0/\u2126m,0\n0.70/0.30\n)1/3\n(13)\nor zm\u039b = 0.33, which is actually pretty recent (see Fig. 1).\nThis raises the question of why dark energy is just starting to dominate the expansion rate\nnow, or equivalently why \u03c1\u039b,0/\u03c1m,0 \u223cO(1), which has been referred to as the coincidence\nproblem1. The argument goes that one needs very special initial conditions in the early\nuniverse for this to be the case. Explanations for how this could more naturally arise abound.\nOne example is postulating that the energy density of dark energy somehow tracks that in\nmatter. Another is invoking an anthropic argument, i.e. in some ensemble of universes\nonly those in which dark energy comes on the scene late would result in intelligent life that\ncould observe the Universe. None of these explanations are particularly appealing but it is\nsafe to say the coincidence problem is not keeping most cosmologists up at night.\n2 Model Universes\nConsider the simplifying assumption that the Universe is dominated by a single energy com-\nponent. In this case the solutions to the Friedmann equation are analytic and is instructive\nto compute them. Assume a \ufb02at universe \ufb01lled with a single substance X whose equation of\nstate parameter w implies that it dilutes as\n\u03c1X \u221da\u22123(1+w), (14)\nas we argued previously from the \ufb02uid equation. In this case the Friedmann equation sim-\npli\ufb01es to\nH2(a) =\n(\u02d9a\na\n)2\n= H2\n0 \u2126X,0a\u22123(1+w) \u21d2\u02d9a2 = H2\n0 \u2126X,0a\u2212(1+3w), (15)\nwhere H0 is the present day value of the expansion rate and \u2126 X,0 = \u03c1X,0/\u03c1c(t0). Note that\neven though this single component approximation is not valid at the present epoch, we are\nstill free to normalize the energy components in terms of \u03c1c,0 using the present day value of\nthe Hubble constant, explaining the appearance of H0 and \u2126X,0 in the equation above.\n1See https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2509 for a discussion\n3\nFigure 1: Left: Evolution of \u03c1/\u03c1c(t= t0) for radiation, matter, and dark energy. Notice the\nthe di\ufb00erent slopes a\u22124, a\u22123, and a0 for the di\ufb00erent components, respectively. Right: Evolu-\ntion of \u2126(z), the fraction of the critical density contributed by each mass-energy component\nof the universe as a function of redshift for a \ufb02at (i.e. k= 0 or \u2126k = 0) universe. Recall that\n\u2126m(z) + \u2126r(z) + \u2126\u039b(z) = 1. Figures taken from https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2509.\nTo solve this equation we assume a power law form for the time dependence of the scale\nfactor\na(t) =\n(t\nt0\n)q\n, (16)\nfrom which we conclude that\nq= 2\n3 + 3w; t0 = 2\n3 + 3w\nH\u22121\n0\u221a\n\u2126X,0\n= 2\n3 + 3w\n( 3\n8\u03c0G\u03c1X,0\n)1/2\n, (17)\nwith the restriction that w\u0338= \u22121, which requires a separate treatment.\n2.1 Radiation Dominated\nAt z \u226bzeq the energy density will be entirely dominated by radiation (see Fig. 1) and we\ncan apply eqn. (17) with w = 1/3 appropriate for radiation and \u2126 r,0 from eqn. (10). This\nyields q= 1/2 and thus\na(t) =\n(t\nt0\n)1/2\n, (18)\nwhere t0 = 2.4 \u00d71019 s = 750 Gyr.\nUsing the previously derived scalings \u03c1r \u221da\u22124, and Tr \u221da\u22121 results in the rough scalings\n4\nfor the radiation dominated early universe\nT\n1010 K \u223c kBT\n1 MeV \u223c\n[ \u03c1r\n107 g cm\u22123\n]1/4\n\u223c1 + z\n1010 \u223c\n[ t\n1 s\n]\u22121/2\n. (19)\nThese relations are approximately correct for 0 < t <1010 s, or z >105. The arbitrarily\nhigh temperatures and densities which are achieved at su\ufb03ciently early times have given this\nstandard cosmological model its generic name, the Hot Big Bang.\n2.2 Matter Dominated\nAs indicated by the right panel of Fig. 1, for cosmic times z \u226a zeq and z \u226b zm\u039b, i.e.\nroughly in the range 2 \u2272 z \u2272 300 it is a good approximation to treat the universe as being\nmatter dominated. During this phase, again assuming a \ufb02at universe, the scale factor is well\napproximated by\na(t) =\n(t\nt0\n)2/3\n, (20)\nwhere t0 = 2H\u22121\n0 /(3\n\u221a\n\u2126m,0). For the case \u2126\u039b,0 = 0 (\u2126m,0 = 1) this is known as the Einstein-\nde-Sitter (EdS) solution.\n2.3 Lambda Dominated\nConsider a spatially \ufb02at universe for which the energy density is contributed only by dark\nenergy with equation of state w= \u22121, i.e. Then the Friedmann equation is\n(\u02d9a\na\n)2\n= H2\n0 \u2126\u039b,0 (21)\nwhere \u2126\u039b,0 = \u03c1\u039b,0/\u03c1c,0 = 8\u03c0G\u03c1\u039b,0/(3H2\n0 ) is the energy density of dark energy relative to the\npresent day critical density. In this case it is easy to show that the resulting solution is a\nUniverse that expands exponentially as a function of time\na(t)\na0\n= eH0\u21261/2\n\u039b,0(t\u2212t0). (22)\nWe will return to this concept of exponential expansion when we discuss the in\ufb02ationary\nepoch.\n3 Distance Measures in Cosmology\n3.1 The Line-of-Sight Comoving Distance\nPreviously we discussed the distinction between the comoving distance r and the proper\ndistance rp. A small comoving distance \u03b4r between two nearby objects in the Universe is\nthe distance between them which remains constant with epoch if the two objects are moving\nwith the Hubble \ufb02ow. In other words, if \u03b4rp is the proper distance between them which\n5\nwould be measured with rulers at the time te they are being observed, then the comoving\ndistance is this \u03b4rp divided by the ratio of the scale factor of the Universe between then and\nnow:\n\u03b4r = \u03b4rp/a(te) = (1 + ze)\u03b4rp. (23)\nThe total line-of-sight comoving distance r from us to a distant object is computed by\nintegrating the in\ufb01nitesimal \u03b4r contributions between nearby events along the radial ray\nfrom z = 0 ( t = t0) to the object. In other words to determine the line-of-sight comoving\ndistance we integrate along the the null geodesic connecting us with the object, which given\nthe equation for a null geodesic ds2 = \u2212cdt2 + a2(t)dr2 = 0, implies dr= cdt/a(t) and hence\ndc =\n\u222b\ndr=\n\u222b t0\nte\ncdt\na(t), (24)\nfrom which we can see that this is a sum of in\ufb01tesimal cdt proper distances divided by the\nscale factor a(t) at each epoch, making it a sum of in\ufb01tesimal comoving distances consistent\nwith the discussion above. Exploiting the fact that\ndt\na = dt\nda\nda\na = da\n\u02d9aa = \u2212dz\n\u02d9a/a = \u2212 dz\nH(z), (25)\nwhere we have used H = \u02d9a/a and a= 1/(1 + z). We can then write\ndc = c\n\u222b z\n0\ndz\u2032\nH(z\u2032) = dH\n\u222b z\n0\ndz\u2032\nE(z\u2032), (26)\nwhere we have de\ufb01ned the Hubble distance\ndH \u2261cH\u22121\n0 = 4.3\n( h\n0.70\n)\u22121\nGpc, (27)\nwritten the Hubble constant today as\nH0 = 70\n( h\n0.70\n)\nkm s\u22121 Mpc\u22121, (28)\nand used the fact that H(z) = H0E(z) where\nE(z) =\n[\n\u2126m,0a\u22123 + \u2126r,0a\u22124 + \u2126v,0 + \u2126k,0a\u22122]1/2\n. (29)\nNote that the line-of-sight comoving distance is not directly observable. Nevertheless, in\nsome sense it is the fundamental distance measure in cosmology since, as we will see below,\nall the other distance measures can be simply expressed in terms of it.\n3.2 Angular Diameter Distance\nSuppose that we can observe some yardstick whose proper length\u2113is known at a cosmological\ndistance. Imagine this yardstick to be aligned perpendicular to our line of sight as illustrated\n6\nFigure 2: An observer at the origin observes a yardstick of proper length \u2113 at a comoving\ndistance r. Figure from Ryden.\nin Fig. 2, such that it has \u03c6=constant, subtends an angle \u03b4\u03b8 on the sky where \u03b4\u03b8 \u226a1, and\nthat the light from this yardstick has a redshift of z corresponding to some cosmic time te.\nThe angular diameter distance is de\ufb01ned by\ndA = \u2113\n\u03b4\u03b8, (30)\nin other words it is equal to the familiar proper distance to the yardstick in the small angle\nlimit that would hold if the universe were static and Euclidean.\nTo determine the relationship between dA and the comoving distance dc we derived above,\nrecall that the metric tells us us how to compute proper distances, and that the proper\ndistance between two points is equal to the length of the spatial geodesic between them with\ntime \ufb01xed at some te and thus with the scale factor a(te) also \ufb01xed, in other words dt= 0\nds2 = a2(te)\n[\ndr2 + S2\nk(r)d\u21262]\n, (31)\nwhere d\u21262 = d\u03b82 +sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62. Thus the distance between two ends of the yardstick in Fig. (2)\nfor which \u03c6=const and r=const\nds= a(te)Sk(r)d\u03b8. (32)\nSetting ds= \u2113 and d\u03b8= \u03b4\u03b8 we deduce\n\u2113= a(te)Sk(r)\u03b4\u03b8 = Sk(r)\u03b4\u03b8\n1 + z . (33)\n7\nUsing the de\ufb01nition of dA above we then have\ndA = \u2113\n\u03b4\u03b8 = Sk(r)\n1 + z. (34)\nWe will typically focus on the case k = 0 for which Sk(r) = r, such that the comoving\ndistance to a distant object which emitted light at te corresponding to redshift z is just the\nline-of-sight comoving distance dc =\n\u222b\ndr= r that we calculated above, thus we \ufb01nd\ndA = dc(z)\n1 + z. (35)\nFig. 3 shows the angular-diameter distance dA for the benchmark model and for two other\nspatially \ufb02at ( k = 0) universes, one dominated by matter and one dominated by a cosmo-\nlogical constant. Note that it does not increase inde\ufb01nitely as z \u2192\u221e; it turns over at z \u223c1\nand thereafter more distant objects actually appear larger in angular size.\nFigure 3: Angular-diameter distance of a yardstick with observed redshift z, in units of the\nHubble distance DH. The bold solid line gives the result for the Benchmark Model. For\ncomparison, the dot-dash line indicates a \ufb02at, lambda-only universe, and the dotted line a\n\ufb02at, matter-only universe. Figure from Ryden.\n8\n3.3 Luminosity Distance\nFigure 4: An observer at the origin observes a source of luminosity Lat comoving coordinate\nlocation (r,\u03b8,\u03c6 ) at time te corresponding to redshift z. Figure from Ryden.\nAnother important distance measure is the luminosity distance dL. Imagine that we have a\nsource whose luminosity Lis known as depicted in Fig. 4. HereLis the bolometric luminosity\nwhich is the speci\ufb01c luminosity L\u03bb integrated over all wavelengths \u03bb. If we measure the \ufb02ux\nof this object f (similarly integrated over all wavelengths) on Earth, we de\ufb01ne the luminosity\ndistance by\ndL \u2261\n( L\n4\u03c0f\n)1/2\n. (36)\nAnalogous to the angular diameter distance, this is what the proper distance to the source\nwould be if the universe were static and Euclidean, since the dilution of light would follow\nthe inverse square law f = L/(4\u03c0d2).\nLet us derive what the luminosity distance dL should be by calculating what the \ufb02ux should\nbe on Earth, which we can always do by working with physical quantities (i.e. proper\ntime, proper distance, observed energy). There are three e\ufb00ects we need to consider in an\nexpanding universe:\n1. At the time time t0 that the light reaches earth, we want to calculate the proper area\nof a sphere drawn around the source and passing through Earth. Again, since we want\na proper area, this can be determined from the metric, in other words for some solid\nangle d\u2126 at the source subtended by a di\ufb00erential area dA on Earth we have\ndA= a2(t0)S2\nk(r)d\u2126. (37)\nNoting that the scale factor is evaluated at z = 0 ( t = t0) which is a(t0) = 1 and\nintegrating over solid angle we obtain:\nA= 4\u03c0S2\nk(r). (38)\n9\n2. Redshifting of the photons due to the expansion of the universe causes the energy of\neach photon from the source to decrease. If the a photon starts with energy Ee = h\u03bde\nwhen the scale factor is a(te), it arrives at Earth with energy E0 = h\u03bd0 = h\u03bdea(te) =\nh\u03bde/(1 + z) reduced by a factor of (1 + z).\n3. Time dilation implies that the time between the photon detections on Earth at t0 is\nlonger than the time between photon emissions at t= te. If two photons emitted in the\nsame direction are separated by a time interval \u03b4te the proper distance between them\nwill initially be c\u03b4te corresponding to a comoving distance c\u03b4te/a(te). By the time we\ndetect these photons on Earth the proper distance between them will be c\u03b4tea(t0)/\na(te) = c\u03b4t0, so we see that \u03b4t0 = (1 + z)\u03b4te.\nPutting this all together we arrive at the correct formula for the observed \ufb02ux on Earth from\nour source of luminosity L at redshift z:\nf = L\n4\u03c0S2\nk(R)(1 + z)2 , (39)\nwhich combined with the de\ufb01nition of luminosity distance in eqn. (36) gives\ndL = Sk(r)(1 + z), (40)\nfrom which we immediately see that\ndL = (1 + z)2dA. (41)\nFor the case where space is \ufb02at recall that\ndA = dc/(1 + z) (42)\nand so\ndL = (1 + z)dc. (43)\nFig. 5 shows the luminosity distancedL as a function of redshift for the Benchmark Model and\nfor two other \ufb02at universes, one dominated by matter and one dominated by a cosmological\nconstant.\n3.4 Lookback Time\nThe lookback time tL to an object is the di\ufb00erence betweeen the age t0 of the universe now\n(at observation) and the age te of the universe at the time photons were emitted by some\nobject. It is used to compare the properties of distant high-redshift objects with evolutionary\nmodels and to quote an overall age of the universe. Recalling that a = 1/(1 + z) and that\nthe expanstion rate \u02d9a/a= H(z) = H0E(z), we have da/a2 = \u2212dz and thus\ndt= dt\ndada= da\naH(a) = \u2212dz\n(1 + z)H(z), (44)\n10\nFigure 5: Luminosity distance as a function of the observed redshift z, in units of the Hubble\ndistance DH. The bold solid line gives the result for the Benchmark Model. For comparison,\nthe dot-dash line indicates a \ufb02at, lambda-only universe, and the dotted line a \ufb02at, matter-\nonly universe.\nand hence\ntL = t0 \u2212te =\n\u222b t0\nte\ndt= tH\n\u222b z\n0\ndz\u2032\n(1 + z\u2032)E(z\u2032), (45)\nwhere we have introduced the Hubble time\ntH = H\u22121\n0 = 13.97\n( h\n0.70\n)\u22121\nGyr (46)\n3.5 Comoving Volume\nThe comoving volumeVC is the volume measure for which the number densities of non-\nevolving objects locked into Hubble \ufb02ow are constant with redshift. It is the proper volume\ntimes three factors of the relative scale factor now to then, (1 + z)3. According to eqn. (26),\n11\nthe derivative of comoving distance is\nd\ndz(dc) = dH\nE(z). (47)\nThe angular diameter distance dA squared converts a solid angle d\u2126 into a proper area dAp,\nthen to get a comoving area dAc requires that we divide by two factors of the scale factor or\nmultiply by (1 + z)2\ndAc = (1 + z)2dAp = d2\nA(1 + z)2d\u2126. (48)\nTo get the di\ufb00erential comoving volume element dVc associated with a solid angle d\u2126 and\nredshift interval dz, we thus mupltiply d\ndz(dc) by dAc which gives\ndVc = dH\n(1 + z)2d2\nA\nE(z) d\u2126dz, (49)\nor\nd2Vc\ndzd\u2126 = dH\n(1 + z)2d2\nA\nE(z) (50)\nBy integrating this expression over some redshift interval z1 to z2 and some solid angle (4 \u03c0\nfor the entire sky), the total comoving volume can be computed. The comoving volume\nelement and its integral are both used frequently in predicting number counts or luminosity\ndensities of extragalactic objects.\n12"

                "Content": "Phys 236: Cosmology\nLecture 5-7: Thermal History\nAn important feature of the standard cosmology is that the temperature of the Universe was\narbitrarily high at the earliest times shortly after the Big Bang. Recall that we derived the\nscalings\nT\n1010 K \u21e0 kBT\n1M e V\u21e0\n\uf8ff \u21e2\n107 gc m\u00003\n\u00001/4\n\u21e0 1+ z\n1010 \u21e0\n\uf8ff t\n1s\n\u0000\u00001/2\n, (1)\nand thus the temperature is decreasing continuously as a function of time. We derived this\nscaling via a simple application of thermodynamics to a small patch of the homogeneous and\nisotropic Universe. In the next few lectures we will show that this thermal history combined\nwith statistical mechanics, particle, nuclear, and atomic physics, allows a detailed prediction\nof the matter content of the universe at each epoch.\n1 General Overview\nPreviously we used the \ufb01rst law of thermodyanmics\ndQ = TdS = dE + PdV, (2)\nand made the assumption that the expansion is adiabaticdQ = TdS =0t od e r i v et h e\ufb02 u i d\nequation\n\u02d9\u21e2 +3 \u02d9a\na (\u21e2 + p)=0 . (3)\nIn deriving the \ufb02uid equation we have made a very strong assumption: the universe is\ncomprised of perfect \ufb02uids which evolve according to a sequence of adiabatic reversible\ntransformations dS = 0, i.e. at each instant the universe is in an equilibrium state. Although\nthe treatment of the contents of the universe as perfect \ufb02uids allowed us to derive the basic\nequations governing the expansion of the universe, it is not su\u0000cient for detailed study\nof the behavior and interactions of realistic particles at high temperature. For this we\nneed to use statistical mechanics to describe the distribution functions of the Universe\u2019s\nconstituent particles, and we need to think very carefully about what it means to be in\nthermal equilibrium. It could be that some particles are in equlibrium with each other,\nwhereas others are not.\nFor example previously we discussed that the Universe is currently permeated with a cosmic\nbackground of relativistic neutrinos as well as the cosmic microwave background. Whereas\nthe CMB is a black-body radiation \ufb01eld atT0 =2 .73 K, the cosmic neutrino background has\nan equilibrium distribution with a di\u21b5erent lower temperatureT\u232b,0 =1 .95 K. The di\u21b5erence\nin these temperatures results from the neutrinos dropping out of equilibrium with the photons\naround one second after the Big Bang. We will discuss this in more detail later, and actually\nderive this temperature di\u21b5erence.\nAs we will see the most general non-equilibrium description of the coupled distributions\nof particle species comes from solving the Boltzman equation. In this context, thermal\n1\nequilibrium dS =0a r i s e sa s s u m i n ge i t h e rn oi n t e r a c t i o n sa m o n gp a r t i c l e s( e . g . a d i a b a t i c\nexpansion), or by assuming a very high rate of interactions such that thermal equilbrium\nbetween di\u21b5erent species can be achieved. The latter scenario is the key to undersatnding\nthe thermal history of the universe. Speci\ufb01cally we will compare therate of interactions\n\u0000t ot h erate of expansionH. When \u0000\u0000 H,t h e nt h et i m es c a l eo fp a r t i c l ei n t e r a c t i o n s\nis much smaller than the characteristic expansion time scale:\ntc \u2318 1\n\u0000 \u2327 tH \u2318 1\nH , (4)\nthen thermal equilibrium will be reached before the e\u21b5ect of the expansion cooling becomes\nrelevant. Particles interact so frequently that they do not care about the cosmological\nexpansion \u2013 any change in their energy density is rapidly shared among other particles\nvia these rapid interactions maintaining thermal equilibrium. For a given particle species\nthe interaction rate is de\ufb01ned by\n\u0000 \u2318 n\u0000vrel = vrel\n\u0000mfp\n, (5)\nwhere n is the number density of projectile particles,vrel is the relative velocity between\nprojectiles and targets, and\u0000 is the interaction cross section, and the last equality used the\nde\ufb01nition of the mean free path\u0000mfp =1 /(n\u0000). Thus the condition \u0000\u0000 H can be thought\nof equivalently as saying that the particle mean free path\n\u0000mfp \u2327 vtH (6)\nis much shorter than the distance it can travel in the Hubble timetH,o ri ft h ep a r t i c l ei s\nrelativistic that the mean free path is much shorter than the Hubble distancedH = c/H.\nNote that \u0000 is di\u21b5erent for di\u21b5erent fundamental interactions and for di\u21b5erent particle species\nand masses. Therefore, the above condition in eqn. (4) is valid for all the known (and perhaps\nunknown) particles in the very early universe but, as the universe expands, it is eventually\nbroken at di\u21b5erent times for di\u21b5erent species. This is the essence of thethermal history\nof the universe.\nAt the very beginning (we are talking about tiny fractions of seconds after the Big Bang)\nall the particles were in thermal equilibrium in a primordial soup known as theprimordial\nplasma,w h i c hi so f t e na l s or e f e r r e dt oa st h eprimordial radiation bath. When for a\nspecies, the condition \u0000\u21e0 H is reached, it decouples from the primordial plasma. If it\ndoes this by breaking the chemical equilibrium of some reaction (for example pair production\ne\u0000 + e+ $ \u0000 + \u0000), then this reaction is said tofreeze out and the products attain some\n\ufb01xed relic abundance.1\nThe fundamental interactions which characterize the aforementioned processes compel some\nparticles to react and transform into others and vice-versa. When \u0000\u0000 H these reactions\ntake place with equal probability in both directions, hence the$ symbol, but when \u0000\u21e0 H\neventually one direction is preferred over the other. This is the characteristic of irreversibility\n1It attains a \ufb01xed abundance if it is a stable particle, of course. If not it disappears.\n2\nwhich causes equilibrium thermodynamics to fail, and thus demands the use of the Boltzmann\nequation. For example, we shall use the Boltzmann equation to calculate the relic abundance\nof CDM, quantify the recombination of protons and electrons into neutral hydrogen atoms,\nand analyze the formation of light elements duringBig Bang Nucleosynthesis.\n2 Brief Summary of Thermal History\nIn what follows we give a brief overview of some of the most important events that took\nplace in the early thermal history of the Universe.\nPlanck scale, in\ufb02ation, and Grand Uni\ufb01ed TheoryIn principle, ast !1 a(t) ! 0,\nbut there comes a point at which this extrapolation of General Relativity, which is not a\nquantum theory of gravity, must break down. This is when the thermal energy of typical\nparticles is such that their de Brogile wavelength is smaller than their Schwarzschild radius:\nquantum black holes clearly cause di\u0000culties with the usual concept of background space-\ntime. Equating 2\u21e1~/(mc)w i t h2Gm/c2 yields a characteristic mass for quantum gravity\nknown as thePlanck mass. This mass, and the corresponding length`Pl = ~/(mPlc), and\ntime `Pl/c form the sytem ofPlanck units:\nmPl \u2318\nr\n~c\nG ' 1019 GeV (7)\n`Pl \u2318\nr\n~G\nc3 ' 10\u000035 m( 8 )\ntPl \u2318\nr\n~G\nc5 ' 10\u000043 s( 9 )\nThe Planck time thus sets the origin of time for the classical phase of the Big Bang. Another\ncommonly used Planck mass unit is\nMPl \u2318\nr\n~c\n8\u21e1G =2 .4 \u21e5 1018 GeV, (10)\nwhere a factor of 8\u21e1 is introduced in the square root. The reason for this is that at early times\nwhen the curvature term/ a\u00002 in the Friedmann equation is negligibly small compared to\nthe steepera dependence of the components of\u21e2, one can then write the Friedmann equation\nas\nH2 = \u21e2\n3M2\nPl\n, (11)\nin particle physics units where~ =1 .\nIn\ufb02ation is another very important piece of the current description of the primordial universe.\nWe shall dedicate a lecture to it later on. For now, it is su\u0000cient to say that it occurs at\nan energy scale of the order 1016 GeV, which is the same scale as the Grand Uni\ufb01ed Theory\n(GUT), i.e. models in which electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions are uni\ufb01ed.\nBaryogenesis and LeptogenesisRelativistic quantum \ufb01eld theory requires the existence\nof anti-particles, which poses a slight puzzle. Particles and anti-particles annihilate through\n3\nprocesses such as\ne\u0000 + e+ $ \u0000 + \u0000. (12)\nIf initally the universe was \ufb01lled with equal amounts of matter and anti-matter then we\nexpect these annihilations to lead to a universe dominated by radiation. Basically, once\nthe universe cools down below the mass energy of some baryon or lepton,kBT . mc2,p a i r\nproduction from the primordial plasma will eventually become energetically unfavorable and\nthe reaction will no longer proceed to the left to produce particles and anti-particles. Instead\nall the matter and anti-matter will annihilate away leaving a universe \ufb01lled with radiation.\nHowever, we do observe an overabundance of matter (mostly baryons) over anti-matter in\nthe universe today. In order for this to be the case there needs to be some primordial matter-\nantimatter asymmetry in the inital conditions. In other words, baryogenesis is the creation,\nvia some as of yet unclear mechanism, of an overall positive baryon number. In order to\nmaintain the neutrality of the universe, we thus also need Leptogenesis, i.e. a mechanism\nwhich produces a non-vanishing lepton number in the form of an excess of electrons over\npositrons. Although many ideas for baryogenesis exist, none is singled out by experimental\ntests. We will not have much to say about baryogenesis in this course.\nElectroweak phase transitionAt a thermal energy of about 100 GeV, which corresponds\nto 10\u000012 seconds after the Big Bang, the electromagnetic and weak forces start to behave\ndistinctly. This leads to a drastic change in the strength of the weak interaction which results\nin a phase transition.\nQCD phase transitionBelow 150 MeV quarks pass from their asymptotic freedom and\nbound states form from two (mesons) or three (baryons) of them. The above energy corre-\nsponds roughly to 20\u00b5sa f t e rt h eB i gB a n g .\nDark matter freeze-outSince dark matter is very weakly interacting with ordinary matter\nwe expect it to decouple relatively early on. We will study the example of WIMPs \u2013 weakly\ninteracting massive particles that freeze out around 10\u0000100 GeV. We will show that choosing\nnatural values for the mass of the dark matter particles and their interaction cross section\nwith ordinary matter reproduces the observed relic dark matter density surprisingly well.\nNeutrino decouplingAt T \u21e0 1010 K corresponding to an energy around 1 MeV, or around\n1 s after the Big Bang a host of interactions between neutrinos/anti-neutrinos, leptons (elec-\ntrons/positrons) and baryons (protons and neutrons) become ine\u21b5ecient and neutrinos drop\nout of thermal equilibrium with the primordial plasma. After this neutrinos decouple and\nsimply redshift away their energy until the present epoch, but their contribution to the total\nradiation energy density of the universe is not negligible. It thus alters when matter radiation\nequality takes place, and as a result the strength of anisotropies in the CMB.\nElectron-positron annihilationThe interaction\ne\u0000 + e+ $ \u0000 + \u0000, (13)\nwill remain in thermal equilibrium provided the energykBT of the primordial plasma is\nlarger than the mass of electrons and positronsmec2 = 511 keV. When the temperature of\nthe thermal bath drops below this value pair production is no longer possible and annihilation\n4\ntakes over. The entropy and energy from these electron/positron pairs is then transferred\nto the photon bath, but since the neutrinos already decoupled earlier, this explains the\nsmall temperature di\u21b5erence between the nutrinos and the CMB today, which we will derive\nexplicitly. Thanks to leptogenesis, positrons disappear and only electrons are left.\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)At t\u21e0 af e wm i n u t e s(T \u21e0 109 K) , nucleosynthesis\nstarts, synthesizing protons and neutrons to produce D, He and a few other elements. Since\nthe temperature is still too high for the formation of neutral atoms, all these elements are\nhighly ionized.\nRecombination At T \u21e0 4000 K (t \u21e0 2 \u21e5 105 yr) roughly 50% of the baryonic matter is in\nthe form of neutral atoms. This point in time is often called the time ofrecombination.\nBecause of the resulting drop in the number density of free electrons, the universe suddenly\nbecomes transparent to photons which is known asdecoupling.T h e s e p h o t o n s a r e o b s e r v e d\ntoday as the cosmic microwave background. From this point on, photons, neutrinos, H, He\nand other atoms all expand freely with the Universe. Just before this time, the energy\ndensity in relativistic particles became smaller than that in the rest mass of non-relativistic\nmatter, and the Universe enters the matter dominated epoch.\n3 Equilibrium Thermodynamics\n3.1 A Note on Units\nWe will always keep units throughout all of our calculations. But as the study of the thermal\nhistory of the universe is concerned with high energy physics, you will often see results in\nother references in the natural unit system in which the speed of lightc,B o l t z m a n n \u2019 s\nconstant kB,a n dP l a n c k \u2019 sc o n s t a n t~ = hP /2\u21e1 are all set to 1. In cgs units [c]=c m s\u00001,\n[~]=g c m2 s\u00001,a n d[kB]=g c m2 s\u00002 K\u00001.T h e r e f o r e , m a k i n g t h e s e c o n s t a n t s d i m e n s i o n l e s s\nimplies that\n[energy] = [mass] = [temperature] = [time]\u00001 =[ l e n g t h ]\u00001, (14)\nand all physical quantities can be expressed in one unit, which is usually energy. Another\nway to state this is that in SI units the fundamental units are mass, length, and time\nwhereas in natural units the fundamental units are velocity, action (energy\u21e5 time), and\nenergy. Since we have set the velocity unitc =1a n dt h ea c t i o nu n i t~ =1 ,t h eo n l y\nremaining thing with dimensions is energy. The unit of choice for energy is the \u201celectron-\nvolt\u201d, where the energy scales are eV in atomic physics, MeV in nuclear physics, and GeV in\nparticle physics. Whenever needed, the \u2018missing\u2019 powers ofc, kB,a n d~ in equations can be\nreinserted straightforwardly from simple dimensional analysis. Appendix C.1 of Baumann\u2019s\nbook has a nice explanation of natural units and how to convert into SI units.\nOne useful thing to note is that number densities in these natural units will typically be\nexpressed as\nn \u21e0 T3 or n \u21e0 (mT)3/2, (15)\n5\nwhich in normal units become\nn \u21e0\n\u2713kBT\n~c\n\u25c63\nor n \u21e0\n\u2713mc2kBT\n~2c2\n\u25c63/2\n\u21e0\n\u2713mkBT\n~2\n\u25c63/2\n. (16)\nFrom these the units of energy density or pressure then just have an extra factor of energy\nmultiplied in, and it should be obvious which constant is needed to get the correct units.\n3.2 Distribution Functions\nFigure 1: Phase space of position and momentum in one dimension. Volume of each cell\nis 2\u21e1~, the smallest region into which a particle can be con\ufb01ned because of Heisenberg\u2019s\nuncertainty principle. Shaded region has in\ufb01nitesmal volumedxdp which covers nine cells.\nTo count the appropriate number of cells, therefore, the phase space integral must be\nR\ndxdp/\n(2\u21e1~)\nAs we discussed, through most of the early universe, reactions proceeded rapidly enough\nto keep particles in equilibrium, such that di\u21b5erent species share a common temperature.\nWe will often want to express the number density, energy density, pressure, etc. in terms\nof this temperature. For this reason, and many others which will emerge shortly, it is\nconvenient to introduce the occupation number, ordistribution function f of a species.\nThis distribution function counts the number of particles in a given region in phase space2\n2Note that here we are working in proper coordinates, i.e.x is a proper position coordinate, and byp\n6\naround a positionx and momentump. Then if we want to determine the energy of a species\nwe would construct the weighted sum of the energy of each state over all of the phase space\nelements: Pf(x, p)E(p).\nHow many phase space elements are there in a region of \u201cvolume\u201ddx3dp3? By Heisenberg\u2019s\nuncertainty principle, no particle can be localized into a region of phase space smaller than\n(2\u21e1~)3, so this is the size of a fundamental element. Therefore, the number of phase space\nelements indx3dp3 is dx3dp3/(2\u21e1~)3 (see Fig. 1). Homogeneity implies that this distribution\nfunction should be independent of positionx,a n di s o t r o p yr e q u i r e st h a tf = f(p)d e p e n d s\nonly on the magnitude of the momentump \u2318| p|.W e c a n t h u s i n t e g r a t e o u t t h e s p a t i a l p a r t\nover the volume to obtain that the density in phase space is the density of states times the\ndistribution function g\n(2\u21e1~)3 \u21e5 f(p), (17)\nwhere g is a degeneracy factor which counts internal degrees of freedom (e.g. spin). The\nnumber densityof particles (in real space) is found by integrating eqn. (17) over momentum\nn = g\n(2\u21e1~)3\nZ\nd3pf(p). (18)\nTo obtain the energy density of the gas particles we have to weight each momentum by\nits energy. To a very good approximation the particles in the early universe were weakly\ninteracting. This allows us to ignore the interaction energies between the particles and simply\nwrite that the energy of a particle of massm and momentump simply as\nE(p)=\np\nm2c4 + p2c2. (19)\nThis then implies that the energy density is\n\u21e2 = g\n(2\u21e1~)3\nZ\nd3pf(p)E(p). (20)\nand the pressure is\nP = g\n(2\u21e1~)3\nZ\nd3pf(p) p2c2\n3E(p), (21)\nwhere the last equation for the pressureP comes from a generalization of the standard\nkinetic theory derivation of the pressure of an ideal gas to the case of a relativistic gas (see\nMukhanov Physical Foundations of Cosmology\u00a7 3.3.2 for a derviation). It is immediately\nclear that if the particles are relativisticE2 \u21e1 p2c2 (see eqn. 19) that eqn. (21) then implies\nP = \u21e2/3o rw =1 /3a sw ea r g u e dp r e v i o u s l yi st h ec a s ef o rr a d i a t i o n .\nhere we mean the not the comoving momentum but rather the proper momentum which redshifts away with\nthe expansion.\n7\n3.3 Equilibrium Distribution Functions\nTo properly describe the physical processes in an expanding universe including departures\nfrom equilibrium, we need, strictly speaking, a full kinetic theory which we will come to\nlater. Fortunately, there are many situations in the early universe when the particles are\nin a state of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) with each other. We qualify\nthis equilibrium with the word local to stress that the Universe cannot be treated as a\ntypical thermodynamic system in equilibrium with an in\ufb01nite thermal bath at some given\ntemperature: it is a dynamically evolving nonequilibrium system. More concretely, we know\nthat the temperature of the thermal bath changes as the universe expands. Therefore, by\nlocal equilibrium we simply mean that matter has maximal possible entropy. In practice\nentropy will be maximized for a species when \u0000\u0000 H as we discussed already. We will come\nto an even clearer de\ufb01nition of what is meant by LTE shortly.\nIt can be shown that for a system of particles constrained to have a \ufb01xed amount of total\nenergy E and number of particlesN the entropy is maximized, and thus the system is in\nLTE, when its particles have the following distribution function\nf(p)= 1\ne(E(p)\u0000\u00b5)/kBT \u00b1 1, (22)\nwhere the + sign is for fermions (electrons, or baryons, i.e. protons and neutrons) which obey\nFermi-Dirac statistics and the\u0000 for bosons (photons) which obey Bose-Einstein statistics.\nAt low temperatures kBT \u2327 E \u0000 \u00b5,b o t hd i s t r i b u t i o nf u n c t i o n sr e d u c et ot h eM a x w e l l -\nBoltzmann distribution\nf(p) \u21e1 e\u0000(E(p)\u0000\u00b5)/kBT . (23)\nThe equilibrium distribution functions have two parameters: the temperatureT and the\nchemical potential \u00b5,w h e r et h ec h e m i c a lp o t e n t i a lc a nb et e m p e r a t u r ed e p e n d e n t .

Speci\ufb01cally, it is de\ufb01ned as the derivative of the entropy with respect to\nthe number of particlesN,a t\ufb01 x e de n e r g ya n d\ufb01 x e dv o l u m e ,m u l t i p l i e db yt h et e m p e r a t u r e\n\u00b5 = \u0000T\n\u2713 @S\n@N\n\u25c6\nE,V\n. (24)\nTaking into account the possibility of changing particle number, the \ufb01rst law of thermody-\nnamics becomes\ndQ = TdS = dE + PdV \u0000 \u00b5dN, (25)\nwhere \u00b5dN is sometimes called thechemical work.\n8\nNow let us consider some reaction that is capable of changing members of one species into\nmembers of another species. We will denote this reaction in the following form:\n\u232b1A1 + \u232b2A2 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \u232blAl =\nX\nj\n\u232bjAj =0 . (26)\nThe coe\u0000cients\u232bl are known as the stoichiometric factors, and they simply specify how the\nnumbers of the di\u21b5erent species are related. For example, consider the reaction\n2H2 +O 2 $ 2H2O. (27)\nIn this caseA1 =H 2, A2 =O 2, A3 =H 2O, \u232b1 =2 , \u232b2 =1 ,a n d\u232b3 = \u00002. The meaning of\nthis is that every forward reaction destroys 2 H2 molecules and 1 O2 molecule, and produces\n2H 2Om o l e c u l e s .\nIn LTE we know thatdS =0w h i c ht h e ni m p l i e s\ndS =\nX\ni\n@S\n@Ni\ndNi = \u0000\nX\ni\n\u00b5i\nTi\ndNi = \u0000\nX\ni\n\u00b5i\nT dNi =0 \u0000!\nX\ni\n\u00b5idNi =0 , (28)\nwhere the last equality used the fact that the temperatures must all be the same in equi-\nlibrium Ti = T.I f t h i s c o n d i t i o nP\ni \u00b5idNi =0w e r en o ts a t i s \ufb01 e dt h e nt h ep a r t i c l e sc o u l d\nconvert into each other to increase the entropy further violating our assumption (dS =0 )o f\nLTE.\nBut given the de\ufb01nition of chemical potential, a single forward reaction results in the follow-\ning change in the entropy\n\u0000\nX\ni\n\u232bi\n\u00b5i\nTi\n, (29)\nand the negative of this for a backward reaction. Thus we can identify dNi = \u232bi.I n\nequilibrium whereT = Ti the condition thatdS =0t h u si m p l i e si nt e r m so ft h es t o c h i o m e t r i c\nfactors X\ni\n\u232bi\u00b5i =0 , (30)\nThe equation above de\ufb01nes what we will refer to aschemical equilibrium.\nIf the number of particles is not constrained then the chemical potential is zero. For example\nfor black body radiation which is an equilibrium con\ufb01gruation, the number of photons in\nthe system is not conserved. A photon may collide with an electron in the wall of the\ncavity, exciting it to a higher energy state, removing a photon from the photon gas. This\nelectron may drop back to its lower level in a series of steps, each one of which releases an\nindividual photon back into the photon gas. Although the sum of the photon energies of\nthe emitted photons are the same as the absorbed photon, the number of emitted photons\nwill vary. Another simple example of photon non-conservation is double Compton scattering\ne\u0000 + \u0000 $ e\u0000 + \u0000 + \u0000 which happens in equilibrium at high-temperatures. The only way that\n9\nthese changes in photon number can maintaindS =0i si f @S/@N =0 ,i m p l y i n g\n\u00b5\u0000 =0 . (31)\nThis implies that if the chemical potential of a particleX is \u00b5X,t h e nt h ec h e m i c a lp o t e n t i a l\nof the corresponding anti-particle\u00afX is\n\u00b5 \u00afX = \u0000\u00b5X. (32)\nTo see this, just consider particle-antiparticle annihilation,X + \u00afX $ \u0000 + \u0000.\nFor the purposes of computing the equilibrium distribution functions we will be able to ignore\nthe chemical potentials because it can be shown that they are negligibly small compared to\nkBT.Y o u w i l l s h o w t h a t t h i s i s t h e c a s e i n t h e h o m e w o r k .B u t f o r s i t u a t i o n s w h e r e w e a r e\ntrying to study chemical equilibrium, we will of course not be able to neglect them.\nFinally, we can now make the distinction betweenkinetic equilibrium and chemical\nequilibrium.C o n s i d e rar e a c t i o nf o rw h i c h\u0000\u0000 H of the type:\nA + B $ C + D, (33)\nor in terms of chemical potentials,\n\u00b5A + \u00b5B = \u00b5C + \u00b5D, (34)\nwhich we de\ufb01ne aschemical equilibrium.\nOn the other hand, when \u0000\u0000 H refers to a reaction such as scattering:\nA + B $ A + B, (35)\nthis is referred to askinetic equilibrium. Mathematically kinetic equilibrium implies that\nthe distribution functions for both species A and B are of the form given in eqn. (22) at the\nsame temperature T.\nIn general, it is possible for a species to break chemical equilibrium and still remain in kinetic\nequilibrium with the rest of the cosmic plasma through scattering processes. We will thus use\nLTE to refer to a situation where the particles under consideration are in kinetic or chemical\nequilibrium (or both). In practical terms LTE will mean the particles under consideration\nshare a common equilibrium temperature Ti = T, and often this temperature T will be\nidenti\ufb01ed with the photon temperatureT\u0000 which we will refer to as the \u201ctemperature of the\nuniverse\u201d.\n3.5 Expressions for n, \u21e2, andP\nGiven the distribution function, we can then calculate the number densityn,e n e r g yd e n s i t y\n\u21e2 and pressure P. In what follows we will work out two important special cases, namely\nrelativistic and non-relativistic particles.\n10\n3.5.1 Relativistic Species: mc2 \u2327 kBT, |\u00b5|\u2327 kBT\nIn the relativistic limit, we can write the energy asE = pc.G o i n g t h r o u g h t h e m a t h o n e\n\ufb01nds for the number density\nn = g(kBT)3\u21e3(3)\n\u21e12~3c3\n\u21e2 1b o s o n s\n3\n4 fermions , (36)\nenergy density\n\u21e2 = g(kBT)4\u21e12\n30~3c3\n\u21e2 1b o s o n s\n7\n8 fermions , (37)\nand pressure\nP = \u21e2\n3 . (38)\nThere are several points here that are worth noting. First, we have now derived from\nstatistical mechanics the equation of state for radiation, and indeed we \ufb01nd thatw = P/\n\u21e2 =1 /3. Second, plugging in numbers for photons which are bosons withg =2w ea r i v ea t\nthe Stefan-Boltzmann relation\n\u21e2\u0000 = aRT4 =4 \u0000SBT4/c; \u0000SB \u2318 k4\nB\u21e12\n60~3c2 =5 .6704 \u21e5 10\u00008Js\u00001m\u00002K\u00004. (39)\nwhere the Stefan-Boltzmann constant is de\ufb01ned above.\n3.5.2 Non-Relativistic Species: mc2 \u0000 kBT, |\u00b5|\u2327 kBT\nIn the limitmc2 \u0000 kBT and |\u00b5|\u2327 kBT we can use the fact thatv2/c2 \u21e0 kBT/(mc2) \u2327 1\n(i.e. v2 \u21e0 kBT/m is the rms velocity of an ideal gas), and hencep2/(m2c2)= v2/c2 \u2327 1.\nThen we can expand the energy to \ufb01rst order inp2/(m2c)2 to obtain\nE =\np\nm2c4 + p2c2 \u21e1 mc2 + p2\n2m. (40)\nIn the non-relativistic limit, the equilibrium distribution functionf(p)a l s oa s s u m e st h e\nMaxwell-Boltzmann form (see eqn. 23), sincemc2 \u0000 kBT implies kBT \u2327 E \u0000\u00b5.C o m b i n i n g\nthese two approximations, eqn. (18) for the particle number density integrates to\nn = g\n\u2713mkBT\n2\u21e1~2\n\u25c63/2\ne\u0000mc2/kBT . (41)\nSo we \ufb01nd that in the non-relativistic limit massive particles are exponentially rare at tem-\nperatures much smaller than their rest-mass energykBT \u2327 mc2.I n a d d i t i o n , p l u g g i n g\neqn. (40) into eqn. (20) gives\n\u21e2 = n(mc2 + 3\n2kBT) \u21e1 nmc2. (42)\n11\nAnalogously for the pressure P,w o r k i n gt o\ufb01 r s to r d e ri np2/(m2c2)i ne q n .( 2 1 )m e a n s\nexpanding E(p)=\np\nm2c4 + p2c2 ' mc2 to zeroth order, it then immediately follows that\nP ' nkBT \u2327 \u21e2 (P ' 0) , (43)\nor w = P/\u21e2 = 0 for matter. Which is the full derivation of what we concluded before, that\nnon-relativistic matter behaves like a dust \ufb02uid.\n3.6 Interpretation\nBy comparing the relativistic limit (kBT \u0000 mc2)a n dt h en o n - r e l a t i v i s t i cl i m i t(kBT \u2327\nmc2), we see that the number density, energy density, and pressure of a particle species\nfall exponentially (are \u201cBoltzmann suppressed\u201d) as the temperature drops below the mass\nof the particle. This re\ufb02ects the coupling to the photon \ufb02uid in the primordial plasma\nat the equilibrium temperature. When kBT \u0000 mc2 the photons have su\u0000cient energy to\ncreate a thermal background number density of particle-antiparticle pairs. However, when\nkBT \u2327 mc2 only an exponential tail of the photon distribution function has su\u0000cient energy\nfor pair creation, causing a similar suppression of their number density.\nThis exponential suppression has several important consequences. First it implies that non-\nrelativistic particles either become exponentially rare, or that their numbers drop below the\ndensity where they interact su\u0000ciently often to stay in equilibrium (recall tht \u0000 =n\u0000v)a n d\nhence they go out of equilibrium ordecouple and the interactions are said tofreeze out.\nBoth cases are of interest.\nFor example, electrons and positrons interact very strongly via the Coulomb force and so\nmaintain equilibrium until there are almost no positrons left atkBT \u2327 mec2 \u21e0 0.5M e V( t h e y\nall annihilate with electrons). Other particles that interact weakly, likeweakly-interacting\nmassive particlesor WIMPs,w h i c ha r ead a r km a t t e rc a n d i d a t e ,w o u l ds i m p l yr a p i d l y\ndrop out of equilibrium and hencefreeze out,p o s s i b l yg i v i n gr i s et oas i g n i \ufb01 c a n tr e l i c\nabundance of matter (indeed this is why they are a dark matter candidate, as we will\ndiscuss).\nFinally, we observe that particles following these equilibrium distributionscan only contribute\nsigni\ufb01cantly to the energy density and pressure when they are relativistic.Thus if we have a\ncollection of relativistic species, each of them having an equilbirium at di\u21b5erent temperatures\nTi,w ec a nw r i t et h et o t a le n e r g yd e n s i t y ,\u21e2R,a sas u mo v e ra l lt h ec o n t r i b u t i o n s\n\u21e2R =\nX\ni\n\u21e2i = \u21e12\n30~3c3 g?(T\u0000)(kBT\u0000)4, (44)\nwhere we have introducedg?,t h ee\u21b5ective number of degrees of freedom,g i v e nb y\ng?(T\u0000) \u2318\nX\nbosons\ngi\n\u2713 Ti\nT\u0000\n\u25c64\n+ 7\n8\nX\nfermions\ngi\n\u2713 Ti\nT\u0000\n\u25c64\n, (45)\nwhere T\u0000 is equilibrium temperature of the photon bath. Note that this only requires the dif-\n12\nferent components to haveequilibrium distributions (which are what determine the densities\nand pressures) at temperaturesTi:t h e c o m p o n e n t s d o n \u2019 t a c t u a l l y n e e d t o m a i n t a i n s t r o n g\nself-interactions such that they are in equilibrium with each other (in which case one would\nhave Ti = T\u0000). As long as an equilibrium distribution is maintained after they go out of\nthermal equilibrium (as we will discuss next), and that they are relativistic, they contribute\nsigni\ufb01cantly to the energy density in the early radiation dominated phase of the universe.\nAs the temperature decreases, the e\u21b5ective number of degrees of freedom in radiation will\ndecrease, as massive particles start behaving non-relativistically whenkBT drops below their\nrest mass-energy. In Fig. 2 we show a numerical calculation of the full evolution ofg?,w h i c h\nis based on the properties of particles in the standard model, which are listed in Table 3.\nWe brie\ufb02y discuss a few regimes of interest:\n\u2022 kBT \u2327 1M e V :t h eo n l yr e l a t i v i s t i cp a r t i c l e sw o u l db et h e3n e u t r i n os p e c i e sa n dt h e\ncorresponding anti-neutrinos3 (fermions, 1 degree of freedom each) and the photons\n(boson, 2 polarization states). Neutrinos at these energies are decoupled from the\nthermal bath (see\u00a7 4), but maintain a thermal distribution at a slightly lower temper-\nature than the photons, withT\u232b =( 4/11)1/3T\u0000 (we will derive this in detail shortly).\nTherefore:\ng? =2|{z}\nphotons\n+\nneutrinos/anti-neutrinos\nz }| {\n7\n8\n\"\n(3 + 3)\u21e5\n\u2713 4\n11\n\u25c64/3#\n' 3.36 .

As the di\u21b5erence between neutrino and photon\ntemperature is due to electron-positron annihilation which occurs at later times (see\ndiscussion in\u00a7 4), we haveT\u232b = T\u0000 and so\ng? =2|{z}\nphotons\n+\nneutrinos/antineutrinos\nz }| {\n7\n8 (3 + 3) + 7\n8 (2 + 2)\n| {z }\nelectrons/positrons\n=1 0.75 (47)\n\u2022 T> 300 GeV: this is above the electroweak uni\ufb01cation scale, and for the particles in\nthe Standard Model we haveg\u21e4 ' 106.75.4\n3Whether or not anti-neutrinos exist depends on whether neutrinos have aMajorana mass or a Dirac\nmass. Anti-neutrinos exist in the latter scenario, whereas in the former scenario neutrinos are their own\nanti-particle like photons. See the Aside on neutrinos in \u00a7 3.1.2 of Baumann\u2019s book for more details.\nSince the total number of degrees of freedom needs to be the same in both of these scenarios to satisfy Big\nBang Nucleosynthesis, we will just refer to the anti-neutrino (i.e. Dirac mass) case for concreteness.\n4If there are additional new particles,g? could increase further.\n13\nFigure 2: The full evolution of the e\u21b5ective degrees of freedomg? with temperature for the standard model.\nThe masses on the top axes indicate a few speci\ufb01c masses of particles in the standard model; at temperatures\nhigher than the mass they are approximately in equilibrium, below the mass they annihilate. The QCD phase\ntransition is more complicated, and the evolution cannot be evaluated analytically in that regime (at higher\ntemperatures the evolution also has non-trivial corrections and may not asymptote to the full thermal result\nof 106.75). The value today,g? =3 .38, is the analytic result (3.36) plus a small correction because neutrino\ndecoupling ande\u0000 \u0000e+ annihilation overlap slightly, slightly heating the neutrinos to a higher temperature\nthan (4/11)T\u0000. The valueg? = 86.25 is what\u2019s you\u2019d expect for everything exceptW+,W \u0000,Z 0, Higgs (which\nall have m \u0000 mW ) and the top quark being in equilibrium, which does not accurately match the plateau\nbecause of non-trivial QCD and electroweak e\u21b5ects.

First consider the following\nquestion: why is the CMB observed to be a perfect black body radiation \ufb01eld today? Recall\nthat a black body radiation \ufb01eld is what results when radiation and matter are in thermal\nequilibrium with each other. At present, the radiation and matter in the universe are wildly\nout of equilbrium with each other. Indeed, most of the baryons are in the form of ionized\ngas in the IGM at temperatureT \u21e0 104 but the CMB is atT =2 .73 K. So what gives, why\nshould the CMB be a perfect black body today?\nThe answer of course is that the radiation and matter were in thermal equilibrium in the past\ndue to Thompson scattering of photons with electrons and at this time the radiation \ufb01eld\nwas a black body. This equilibrium was maintained until some timetf , which we will refer to\nas the time of ofphoton decouplingwhich is closely related to (but not exactly the same)\nas last scattering.T h e p h o t o n s d e c o u p l e f r o m t h e m a t t e r b e c a u s e d u r i n grecombination\nthe formation of the \ufb01rst atoms rapidly decreases the electron density causing the opacity to\nsuddenly drop. After this timetf ,t h ec o n d i t i o n\u0000\u0000 H is violated (where \u0000 is the Thompson\nscattering rate), the universe becomes transparent to Thompson scattering, and the photons\ndecouple from the matter. The CMB is thus a relic radiation \ufb01eld, and the black body that\nis frozen in is a vestige of the timest<t f when it was in thermal equilibrium. Let\u2019s now\n14\nFigure 3: The standard model particles, with their mass, spin and degeneraciesgs. Table from Baumann.\nunderstand how this works mathematically using what we have learned.\nRecalling our expression for the number density in terms of the distribution function in\neqn.

We can write that their distribution functionn(\u232b, t)o b e y s\nn(\u232b, t)d\u232b =\n\uf8ffa(tf )\na(t)\n\u00003\nn(\u232b0,t f )d\u232b0, (50)\nwhich simply expresses conservation of the number of photons after decoupling. Hence the\nfactors [a(tf )/a(t)]3,w h i c ha r i s ef r o mt h ed i l u t i o no fp h o t o n sd u et oc o s m i ce x p a n s i o n . W e\ncan relate \u232b0 at t = tf to \u232b at time t by noting that aftertf photons simply redshift away\ntheir energy, such that\u232b = \u232b0a(tf )/a(t) ! \u232b0 = \u232ba(t)/a(tf ). So we \ufb01nd\nn(\u232b, t)d\u232b =\n\uf8ffa(tf )\na(t)\n\u00003\nn[\u232ba(t)/a(tf ),t f ]d[\u232ba(t)/a(tf )]. (51)\nWe thus see that the ratio of scale factorsa(t)/a(tf )a l lc a n c e le x c e p ti nt h ee x p o n e n t i a l ,s o\nthat the number density at timet is given by\nn(\u232b, t)d\u232b = 8\u21e1\nc3\n\u232b2d\u232b\neh\u232b/kBT(t) \u0000 1; T(t)= T(tf )a(tf )/a(t). (52)\nThus the distribution of photon energies retains the black-body form even afer the photons\nwent out of equilbrium with matter, but with a temperature that decreases with time as\nT / a\u00001.\nIn general, if some particle speciesi dropped out of thermal equilibrium with (decoupled\nfrom) the hot plasma at some timetf , its temperature at that time is approximately equal\nto the photon temperature at that timeTf \u2318 T\u0000(tf ), where hot plasma refers now to all\nrelativistic species including photons which we indicate asT\u0000 (or sometimes justT). After\ndecoupling, the mean interaction rate \u0000 of the particle drops below the expansion rateH,\nand the particle moves on a geodesic. As we have seen the momentum of a particle scales as\np / a\u00001 due to Hubble drag, which is valid for both relativistcic and non-relativistic species.\nSince the relative momenta are conserved as we\u2019ve just seen for the example of the CMB,\n16\nthe actual distribution function att>t f can be written as\nf(p, t)= f(p a(t)\na(tf ),t f ). (53)\nIn other words, the form of the distribution function is \u2018frozen-in\u2019 the moment the particles\ndecouple from the hot plasma, and the only thing that evolves with time is the temperature\nof that distributionTi.\nIf a species is still relativistic after decoupling such thatE = pc,t h e nw eh a v e\nf(p, t)= g\n2\u21e1~3\n\u21e2\nexp\n\uf8ff pc\nkBTi\n\u0000\n\u00b1 1\n\u0000\u00001\n; Ti(t)= Tf\na(tf )\na(t) . (54)\nThus, as we\u2019ve just seen for the CMB, the distribution of a decoupled, relativistic species is\nself-similar to that of a relativistic species in thermal equilibrium, but with a temperature\nTi(t). Note that this does not necessarily equal to the temperature of the hot plasma at this\nlater timet,a sw es h a l ls e ei nam o m e n t .\nIf the species is already non-relativistic when it decouples, its energy is given byE = mc2+p2/\n2m,a n ds i n c ekBT \u2327 mc2 we can ignore the\u00b11t e r ms ot h a tt h ed i s t r i b u t i o nf u n c t i o ni s\nMaxwell-Boltzmann\nf(p) \u21e1 e\u0000E(p)/kBT .

Note however that because of the di\u21b5erentp2\ndependence in the exponential, and thep / a\u00001 dependence, this implies that the tempera-\nture of this decoupled distribution scales di\u21b5erently as\nTi = Tf\n\uf8ffa(tf )\na(t)\n\u00002\n.

As we\nwill see, in cosmology entropy is more informative than energy. It is easy to show that the\nentropy is conserved in LTE, as you showed on the homework.\nAccording to the second law of thermodynamics, the total entropy of the universe only\nincreases or stays constant. Since there are far more photons than baryons in the universe,\nthe entropy of the universe is dominated by the entropy of the photon bath (at least as long\nas the universe is su\u0000ciently uniform). Any entropy production from irreversible processes\nis therefore totally insigni\ufb01cant relative to the total entropy. To a good approximation, we\ncan therefore treat the expansion of the universe as adiabatic, so that the total entropy of\nthe universe stays constant even if di\u21b5erent particles species have dropped out of equilibrium\nat various times.\nThe entropy density is de\ufb01ned by\ns \u2318 S\nV , (59)\nand you demonstrated in the homework that this is a conserved quantity, i.e.\nsa3 =c o n s t a n t. (60)\nWe brie\ufb02y review how this is derived. The \ufb01rst lawof thermodynamcs can be written\ndS(V,T )= 1\nT (dU + PdV )= 1\nT {d [\u21e2(T)V ]+ P(T)dV } . (61)\nIn general the di\u21b5erential ofS can be written\ndS(V,T )= @S\n@V dV + @S\n@T dT. (62)\nReading o\u21b5 the partial derivatives by comparing eqns. (61) and (62), and applying the\nintergrability condition\n@2S\n@V @T = @2S\n@T@V , (63)\nyields\ndP\ndT = \u21e2(T)+ P(T)\nT . (64)\nNow rewriting the \ufb01rst law as\ndS = 1\nT (\u21e2dV + Vd \u21e2+ PdV )= 1\nT (\u21e2dV + Vd \u21e2+ PdV + Vd P\u0000 Vd P)\n= 1\nT d [(\u21e2 + P) V ] \u0000 V\nT2 (\u21e2 + P) dT\n= d\n\uf8ff(\u21e2 + P)V\nT\n\u0000\n, (65)\n18\nwhere the second line used eqn. (64). Since the entropy must be stationary in LTE,dS =0 ,\nthis then implies\nS = (\u21e2 + P)V\nT +c o n s t a n t. (66)\nSince the total entropy should be an extensive quantityS / V , we can choose this constant\nto be zero. Thus the entropy density iss = S/V\ns = \u21e2 + P\nT . (67)\nNow what about the time evolution ofs.W e l l w e k n o w t h a t i n L T E t h e e n t r o p y i s s t a t i o n a r y\ndS =0 .

(72)\nNotice that g?S is equal to g? in eqn. (45) only when all the relativistic species are in\nequilibrium at the same temperature. From now on we will simly take T = T\u0000 as the\ntemperature of the universe.\nConservation of entropy has several important consequences, which we know brie\ufb02y discuss.\n\u2022 Scaling ofT with scale factora With our de\ufb01nition ofg?S conservation of entropy\ncan be written:\ng?S(T)T3a3 =c o n s t) T / g\u00001/3\n?S (T)a\u00001, (73)\n19\nwhich follows simply fromsa3 =c o n s t( c o n s e r v a t i o no fe n t r o p y )a n dt h ed e \ufb01 n i t i o no f\ng?S(T)a b o v e . A tt e m p e r a t u r e sa w a yf r o mp a r t i c l em a s st h r e s h o l d st h r e s h o l d sg?S(T)\nis approximately constant and thusT / a\u00001 as we expect for radiation. The factor of\ng\u00001/3\n?S (T) accounts for the fact that whenever a particle species becomes non-relativistic\n(freezes out) and disappears, its entropy is transferred to the other relativistic species\nstill present in the thermal plasma, causingT to thus descrease slightly less slowly\nthan a\u00001 (sometimes this is called \u201cheating\u201d). We will see an example of this in the\nnext section.\n\u2022 Entropy is a useful reference quantity for number densities:Becase s / a\u00003,\nthe number of particles in a comoving volume is therefore proportional to the number\ndensity ni divided by the total entropy density\nNi \u2318 ni\ns . (74)\nIf particles are neither produced nor destroyed, thenni / a\u00003,a n dNi is constant.\nThis is very useful when we describe decoupled relics which are frozen in. The point\nis that because the number of degrees of freedomg? could be changing throughout\nthe radiation dominated phase (see Fig. 2) the expansion history, the temperature\nevolution, and the total number of photons are not simple functions ofa or time, and\nnot that easy to relate to the number of CMB photons today (which we know well).\nThe equation above says thatNi is the number of particles per unit total entropy,\nand if particles are conserved (say after decoupling) since total entropy is conserved,\nit is then trivial to determine the number density of relics at timet = t0,b ys i m p l y\nmultiplying the present day value of the entropy densitys0 by Ni. Another example\nis the total baryon number. I can computenB,0/s0 today and this has to be equal to\nthe total baryon number just after the epoch of baryogenesisnB/s =( nb \u0000n\u00afb)/s (since\nbaryons don\u2019t decay away).\n\u2022 Relativistic (hot) relics are comparable in number to CMB photons:\nFinally, we saw earlier (eqn. 58) that for any decoupled species we can write,\nn(t)=\n\uf8ffa(tf )\na(t)\n\u00003\nneq(tf ). (75)\nIf the species is relativistic when it decouples its number density is, from eqn. (36),\nn = g(kBT)3\u21e3(3)\n\u21e12~3c3\n\u21e2 1b o s o n s\n3\n4 fermions . (76)\nFor the moment absorb the factor of 1 or 3/4i n t os o m ege\u21b5 where ge\u21b5 = g for bosons\nand ge\u21b5 =( 3/4)g for fermions, whereg is here the degeneracy factor of the decoupled\nspecies. Then we can compare the number density of a relativistically decoupled species\n20\nto that of the CMB photonsnCMB at some later timet>t f\nn(t)\nnCMB(t) = neq(tf)\nnCMB(t)\n\uf8ffa(tf )\na(t)\n\u00003\n= ge\u21b5\ng\u0000\n\u2713Tf\nT\n\u25c63 \uf8ffa(tf )\na(t)\n\u00003\n, (77)\nwhere T = T(t)i st h et e m p e r a t u r eo ft h ep h o t o n sa n dg\u0000 =2i st h ed e g e n e r a c yf a c t o r\nfor photons. But now we can use entropy conservation (eqn. 73) to write\ng?S(Tf )T3\nf a3\nf = g?S(T)T3a3 )\n\u2713Tf\nT\n\u25c63 \uf8ffa(tf )\na(t)\n\u00003\n= g?S(T)\ng?S(Tf ). (78)\nPlugging this in above \ufb01nally gives\nn(t)\nnCMB(t) = ge\u21b5\n2\ng?S(T)\ng?S(Tf ). (79)\nThis illustrates that the number density of any relic background of relativistic particles\nis comparable to the number density of CMB photons. Note that this equation also\nremains valid even if the particles later become non-relativistic (by redshifting away\ntheir energy and momentum) such thatkBT(tNR) \u21e0 mc2 some time after decoupling\nwhere tNR >t f .\n4 Neutrino Decoupling\nNeutrinos are fermions (spin 1/2p a r t i c l e s )t h a ti n t e r a c to n l yv i at h ew e a kf o r c ea n dg r a v i t y .\nThey are electrically neutral and have a massm\u232bc2 . 0.1e V ( i . e .. 2 \u21e5 10\u00007 times smaller\nthan the electron) such that they will esentially always be relativistic. There areN\u232b three\n\ufb02avors of neutrinos: electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos, and tau neutrinos, although only\nthe electron neutrinos take part in electromagnetic interactions. Since neutrinos are spin 1/2\nfermions we expect their degeneracy factorg to be g\u232b = 2. However, only one of these spin\nstates, so calledleft-handed or active neutrinos have ever been observed, so we will assume\ng\u232b = 1. Neutrinos with the other spin-state are calledright-handed or sterile neutrinos,\nwhich are hypothetical particles which are postulated to interact only via gravity but not via\nthe fundamental interactions of the Standard Model. Sterile neutrinos have been advocated\nas possible candidates for the dark matter. In what follows we focus on the active neutrinos\nwhich decoupled around 1s after the Big Bang and calculate the temperature of the cosmic\nneutrino background, which we argued previously has a temperatureT\u232b =\n\u0000 4\n11\n\u0000\nTCMB.\nNeutrinos maintain thermal equilibrium with the primordial plasma through interactions\n21\nFigure 4: Thermal history through electron-positron annihilation.

The photons are thus \u201cheated\u201d\nrelative to the neutrinos, which is to say that the decoupled neutrino temperature decreases\nas a\u00001, whereas the photon temperture decreases more slowly, as shown in Fig. 4.

Whereas, what we desire is a relationship between two temperatures,\nthe decoupled neutrino temperatureT\u232b and the temperature of the CMB. Note that sincea2\nis after electron-positron annihilation, and neutrino decoupling, only the two photon degrees\nof freedom occupy the so-called thermal bath, in other words, we just have a thermal bath of\nphotons (coupled to baryons and leptons, but recall that non-relativistic particles contribute\nno signi\ufb01cant energy or entropy) and decoupled neutrinos (which travel along geodesics).\nAfter this point the photon temperatureT\u0000(a) / a\u00001 all the way up to the present epoch\nsince there will be no further changes in the number of relativistic degrees of freedom, i.e.\nT\u00002 is just the CMB temperature ata2.B u t b y t h e s a m e r e a s o n i n g ,T\u00002 6=( a1/a2)T\u00001 (e.g.\nsee Fig. 4).\nSo in order to eliminateT\u00001 we need to use the fact that the neutrinos are just traveling\nalong geodesics and not interacting with anything anymore. This means that their energy\nis simply being redshifted away by Hubble drag, i.e.T\u232b / a since the timea1 at which they\nwere in thermal equilibrium. An equivalent way to state exactly the same thing is to say\n24\nthat their entropy isseparately conservedsince they decoupled, that is\ns\u232b / T3\n\u232b and s\u232ba3 =c o n s t) T\u232b / a\u00001, (91)\nwhich implies\nT\u232b = a1\na2\nT\u00001, (92)\nUsing this in eqn.

The expression above remarkably\ndoes not depend onN\u232b or g\u232b (although the energy density does). Plugging in numbers we\n\ufb01nd that forT\u00000 =2 .725 K, we getT\u232b0 =1 .945 K.\nUsing the expressions for energy density in eqn.

We have either\nassumed LTE, or as in the case of neutrino decoupling, used entropy conservation to relate\ndi\u21b5erent times in the universe\u2019s thermal history where some departure from LTE ocurred.\nBut in order to treat other fundamental issues in the Universe\u2019s thermal history like: the\npossibility of dark matter being athermal relic, the recombination of electrons with protons\nat decoupling, and the synthesis of the light elements, we need to be able to understand\ndepartures from equilibrium. The formal tool to describe the evolution beyond equilibrium\nis the Boltzmann equation, which appears extraordinarily simple although solutions can be\nincredibly complicated. For some species of particlei it reads\ndfi\ndt = Ci[f]. (96)\nHere fi is the one-particle distribution function andCi[f]i st h ec o l l i s i o n a lt e r m5 that depends\non fi,a sw e l la sa l lo t h e rd i s t r i b u t i o nf u n c t i o n sfj which particle i can interact with.

But note thatx and p are themselves functions of time\nbecause of the particle motion. Thus the time derivative that we wrote above is actually a\n\u201cconvective derivative\u201d analogous to in \ufb02uid mechanics, and it actually becomes\ndfi\ndt = @fi\n@t + dx\ndt \u00b7r xfi + dp\ndt \u00b7r pfi. (97)\nIn the current cosmological context, we can simplify this derivative in a few ways. First\nnote that by homogeneityrxfi =0 ,a sw ea r g u e dp r e v i o u s l yw h e nd i s c u s s i n ge q u i l i b r i u m\ndistribution functions. Furthermore,\ndpk\ndt = dpk\nda \u02d9a = \u0000Hpk, (98)\nwhere the last equality used the fact that Hubble drag impliesp / a\u00001,a n dh e n c e\ndpk\nda = \u0000pk\na . (99)\nThus the Boltzmann equation simpli\ufb01es to\ndfi\ndt = @fi\n@t \u0000 Hp \u00b7r pfi = Ci[f]. (100)\nNow we can integrate the equation above over mometnum space\nR\nd3p/(2\u21e1~)3,a l s ok n o w n\nas taking the \u2018zeroth moment\u2019, to obtain an expression for the number densityni\ndni\ndt +3 Hni =\nZ d3p\n(2\u21e1~)3 Ci[f], (101)\nwhere the \ufb01rst term on the left-hand side is obvious6, the second term on the left is less\nobvious but obtainable by integrating by parts7,a n dt h er i g h th a n ds i d ei ss o m ev e r yd i \u0000 c u l t\nthing to calculate depending on the set of particle interactions you are dealing with.\nThis form of the Boltzman equation in terms ofni for a homogenous and isotropic universe\n6You may have noticed that there is a missing degeneracy factorgi here. Just assume we have incorporated\nthat into the distribution functionfi\n7This is relatively straightforward to show, i.e. you get terms like\nR\ndp4\u21e1p3d f/dp, and uv part of the\nintegration by parts vanishes provided thatf(p) ! 0 as p !1 as any well-behaved distribution function\nshould.\n26\nbecomes even more intuitive if we write it as\n1\na3\nd(nia3)\ndt =\nZ d3p\n(2\u21e1~)3 Ci[f] \u2318 C0\ni[nj]. (102)\nIn this form it lends itself to an intuitive interpretation. In the absence of collisionsC0 =0 ,\nthe Boltzman equation indicates thatnia3 is a conserved quantity. Since n represents a\nphysical (proper) number density, this states that the universal Hubble expansion causes\nthe volume of a region containing a \ufb01xed number of particles to grow asa3,a n dh e n c et h e\nphysical number density of these particles falls o\u21b5 asa\u00003.E q u i v a l e n t l y w e c a n s a y t h a t i n\nthe absence of collisions the comoving number densityN = na3 is conserved. Sometimes\nwe will describe this collisionless scenario by saying that the particles are \u201ctraveling along\ngeodesics\u201d, or \u201cexpanding with the Hubble \ufb02ow\u201d. The collisions with other particlesnj,\nencapsulated in the collision termC0\ni[nj], causes departures from these geodesics. Let us\nnow consider the impact of these collisions.\nBecause interactions between three or more particles are very unlikely, for concreteness let us\nfocus our attention on the number densityn1 of a single particle species 1, and that the only\nprocess a\u21b5ecting the abundance of this species is an annihilation with species 2, producing\ntwo particles, which we will call 3 and 4. Similarly the inverse process can also occur: 3 and\n4 can also combine to produce particles 1 and 2. We can represent this reaction as\n1+2 $ 3+4 . (103)\nClearly the rate of change in the abundance of species 1 is given by the di\u21b5erence betweeen\nthe rates for producing and eliminating the species. For this simple case the collision term\nsimpli\ufb01es and we can write the Boltzmann equation as8\n1\na3\nd(n1a3)\ndt = \u0000\u21b5(T)n1n2 + \u0000(T)n3n4. (104)\nThe right hand side can be understood as follows. The \ufb01rst term,\u0000\u21b5n1n2,d e s c r i b e st h e\nrate of destruction of species 1, whereas the second term,\u0000n3n4 describes its creation rate\nwhen 3 and 4 come together. It is intuitive that the destruction rate is proportional ton1\nand n2 and the creation rate proportional ton3 and n4.T h e p a r a m e t e r\u21b5(T)c a nb ew r i t t e n\nas\n\u21b5(T) \u2318h \u0000vi, (105)\nwhere \u0000 is the interaction cross-section for the 1\u0000 2a n n i h i l a t i o nr e a c t i o nt h a tp r o d u c e s\n3 \u0000 4p a r t i c l e s ,a n dv is the relative velocity between the projectile particles 1 and the\ntarget particles 2. The angle brackets indicate that we are using the appropriate velocity\n8This equation is actually an approximation. See Dodelson\u00a7 3.1, Piatella\u00a7 3.8, or Kolb and Turner\u00a7 5.1\nfor the details of what is actually being assumed here. We are essentially assuming that all the reactants\nhave a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and are coupled to the thermal bathT. For example if the reaction\nwas \u232b +\u00af\u232b $ e+ +e\u0000, then the charge of the electrons and positrons and electromagnetic interactions enforce\nkinetic equilibrium between them and the thermal bath. The Maxwell-Boltzmann assumption is equivalent\nto saying the occupation numbers of all the particle species are low, i.e. we are neglecting Fermi-blocking\nand Bose-enhancement e\u21b5ects.\n27\ndistribution averaged cross-section, and it is intuitive that this should be a function of the\ntemperature of the thermal bathT.\nNow we can relate\u21b5(T)t o \u0000(T) by noting that if the system were in thermal equilibrium,\nthe left hand side of the Boltzmann equation would have to be zero. This is a common\ntrick in statistical mechanics where you hypothetically take the system to thermodynamic\nequilibrium to determine the relationship between forward and backward reaction rates.\nSpeci\ufb01cally it allows you to express the ratio of forward and backward reaction rates as\nratios of equilibrium number densities. In this other context it goes by the name of thelaw\nof mass actionand the principle ofdetailed balance. The beauty of this trick is that\neven though we are discussing a non-equilibrium situation, we can still obtain a realtionship\nbetween forward and backward rates, by insisting that they be equal in equilibrium.\nApplying this argument to the case at hand we \ufb01nd that the relationship between\u0000(T)a n d\n\u21b5(T)= h\u0000vi must be\n\u0000 = n0\n1n0\n2\nn0\n3n0\n4\nh\u0000vi, (106)\nwhere n0\ni are the number densities in thermal equilibrium which we calculated previously.\nThus we can recast the Boltzmann equation as\n1\na3\nd(n1a3)\ndt = \u0000h\u0000vin1n2\n\uf8ff\n1 \u0000\n\u2713n3n4\nn1n2\n\u25c6\u0000\u2713n0\n3n0\n4\nn0\n1n0\n2\n\u25c6\u0000\n. (107)\n6 Dark Matter and Thermal Relics\nWe will now discuss the idea that dark matter could be a thermal relic of the Hot Big Bang.\nThe idea here is that at some point in the Universe\u2019s thermal history dark matter was in\nthermal equilibrium with particles from the standard model which make up the photon bath,\nand that it satis\ufb01ed \u0000\u0000 H. As the universe expanded and cooled this reaction eventually\nfreezes out when \u0000 \u21e0 H, and we are left with arelic abundance of cold dark matter\nparticles. If we can calculate this abundance, we can put constraints on the cross-section\nand mass of the dark matter particles by requiring that this abundance match the amount\nof cold dark matter in the universe determined from cosmological observations. This topic is\nobviously speculative because it requires that we make assumptions about the physical nature\nof the unknown dark matter particles. For concreteness, we will focus on the hypothesis that\ndark matter is composed ofweakly interacting massive particles(WIMPs).\nConsider the following process\nX + \u00afX $ l + \u00afl, (108)\nwhere X represents the dark matter particle andl is a lepton.

(113)\nFinally, note that if we consider times when the number of degrees of freedom are not\nchanging, thena / 1/T, we can also equivalently adopt a new time coordinate that highlights\nwhen interesting things are expected to happen, namely when the dark matter particle of\nmass m transitions from being relativistic to non-relativistic. For this calculation we are\nmost interested in cold dark matter, which is to say acold thermal relicthat decouples\nfrom the photon bath when it is non-relativistic, although in the homework you will consider\na hot thermal relic,w h i c hi sas p e c i e st h a td e c o u p l e sw h e ni ti ss t i l lr e l a t i v i s t i c . W e\nknow that the number density of a particle will be exponentially suppressed when it goes\nnon-relativistic, resulting in a similar suppression of \u0000, and ultimately decoupling.\nThis motivates us to de\ufb01ne\nx \u2318 mc2\nkBT , (114)\nwhere m is the mass of the dark matter particle.

You will see all variants of this rescaling in cosmology books,\nand we will switch to scaling by the entropy in just a moment.

(120)\nFig. 5 provides a schematic illustration of particle freeze-out.\n31\nLet\u2019s now do a more quantitative analysis to con\ufb01rm this qualitative description and estimate\nthe mass density in a cold thermal relic. As we mentioned in\u00a7 3.8, it is often advantageous\nto work with the ratio of number density to entropy density owing to the fact that the total\nentropy of the universe is conserved. Recall that the total entropy density can be written\ns = 2\u21e12\n45~3c3 g?S(T)(kBT)3. (121)\nWe thus de\ufb01ne the following quantities\nY \u2318 nX\ns ,Y eq \u2318 n0\nX\ns , (122)\nallowing us to write the Boltzmann equation as\ndY\ndt = \u0000sh\u0000vi\n\u21e5\nY 2 \u0000 Y 2\neq\n\u21e4\n(123)\nAgain, since most of the interesting dynamics will take place whenkBT \u21e0 mc2 we adopt the\nmore convenient time coordinatex \u2318 mc2/kBT.T o r e w r i t e t h e t i m e d e r i v a t i v e i n t e r m s o f\nx we note that\ndx\ndt = d\ndt\n\u2713mc2\nkBT\n\u25c6\n= \u0000x\nT\ndT\ndt ' Hx, (124)\nwhere we have assumed thatT / a\u00001.R e c a l lt h a ti ng e n e r a lT3a3g?S(T)=c o n s t ,s ow ea r e\nassuming that no major changes in the number of degrees of freedom occur over the times\nrelevant to this particle freeze-out so that we can writeg?S \u21e1 const \u2318 g?S(m). Since we are\nassuming that we are deep in the radiation dominated era recall thatH2 / a\u00004 and hence\nH / a\u00002 / T2 / x\u00002 so we can write\nH = H(m)\nx2 , (125)\nwhere H(m)= H(x = 1) is the Hubble parameter corresponding to a thermal energy\nkBT = mc2.W et h e n\ufb01 n a l l ya r r i v ea tt h es o - c a l l e dRiccati equation,\ndY\ndx = \u0000 \u0000\nx2\n\u21e5\nY 2 \u0000 Y 2\neq\n\u21e4\n, (126)\nwhere\n\u0000 \u2318 2\u21e12(mc2)3h\u0000vig?S(m)\n45H(m)~3c3 .

The departure from equilibriumY = Yeq implied by\nthe Boltzmann equation solution is what we described asfreeze-out and, as we discussed,\nit takes place approximately when \u0000\u21e0 H.\n32\nFigure 6: Abundance of dark matter particles as the temperature drops below the mass, i.e.\nx = mc2\nkBT . Figure from Baumann.\nA numerical solution to eqn. (126) is shown in Fig. 6. In practical terms this is done by\nchoosing a small initial value ofx = xi and initalizing Y (xi)= Yeq(xi)a n d\ufb01 x i n g\u0000 to be\na constant. Notice that \u0000 parameterizes the interaction rate. One sees that the freeze-\nout abundance Y1 decreases as \u0000 increases. This makes intuitive sense: larger interaction\nrates maintain equilibrium longer and \u0000\u21e0 H occurs deeper into the Boltzmann-suppressed\nregime, resulting in a lower overall relic abundance.\nFrom inspection of Fig. 6 one observes also that the freeze-out, i.e. when the abundance\nY departs from Yeq,o c c u r sa r o u n dav a l u eo fxf ' 10.

For x>x f,w ek n o wt h a tYeq drops rapidly to zero, and the Boltzmann equation\ncan be written dY\ndx \u21e1\u0000 \u0000\nx2 Y 2;( x>x f).

(130)\nAfter freeze-out whenY has attained Y1 the number of dark matter particles per unit of\nentropy is \ufb01xed (recall the discussion in\u00a7 3.8, that this is a conserved quantity if the dark\nmatter particle number does not change after freeze-out). We can now write down the\npresent day energy density in dark matter as follows:\n\u21e2X0 = nX0m = mY1s0, (131)\nwhere\ns0 = 2\u21e12\n45~3c3 g?S(T0)(kBT0)3 (132)\nis the present day entropy density. Or expressing this relative to the critical density we have\n\u2326X0 = \u21e2X0\n\u21e2crit,0\n= mxf\n\u0000\ns0\n\u21e2crit,0\n, (133)\nwhere we used eqn. (130). Combining eqn.

The Planck satellite has made a\npercent level measurement of the density in cold dark matter \u2326CDMh2 =0 .1200\u00b10.0012. The\nfact that a cross-section with an order of magnitude characteristic of the weak interaction\nG2\nF \u21e0 10\u000010 GeV\u00002 gives the right order of magnitude for the cold dark matter abundance\nis what is known as theWIMP miracle.\n35\nPhys 236: Cosmology\nLecture 8: Recombination and Decoupling\nAn important event in the history of the early Universe is the formation of the \ufb01rst atoms.\nAt temperatures above about 1 eV, the universe still consisted of a plasma of free electrons\nand nuclei. Photons were tightly coupled to the electrons via Compton scattering, which in\nturn strongly interacted with protons via Coulomb scattering. There was very little neutral\nhydrogen. When the temperature became low enough, the electrons and nuclei combined to\nform neutral atoms, and the density of free electrons fell sharply. This event which formed\nthe \ufb01rst atoms in the Universe is known asrecombination. As the electrons disappear onto\natoms the scattering rate \u0000 of photons o\u21b5 of electrons drops below the expansion rate and the\nphotons decouple from the matter and the universe becomes transparent, which is known as\ndecoupling. Today, these photons are observed as the cosmic microwave background, and\nthe fact that decoupling happened so abruptly explains why we appear to see CMB photons\norginating from a surface known as thelast scattering surface, as shown in Fig. 1\nFigure 1: An observer is surrounded by a spherical last scattering surface. The photons of\nthe CMB travel straight to us from the last scattering surface, being continuously redshifted.\nThe distance back to the last scattering surface atz ' 1100 is almost equal to our particle\nhorizon. Figure taken from Ryden.\n1\nFor these two events, recombination and decoupling, the relevant interactions are:\np + e\u0000 $ H+ \u0000,\ne\u0000 + \u0000 $ e\u0000 + \u0000. (1)\nDecoupling occurs just after recombination for the obvious reason that it is the disapearance\nof the electrons onto atoms that causes the Thompson scattering rate to plummett thus\nfreeing the photons from the plasma.\n1 Recombination\n1.1 Baryon to Photon Ratio\nPreviously we noted that if the particle number is not changing, then becausen / a\u00003 and\ns / a\u00003,t h e i rr a t i o ,t h en u m b e ro fp a r t i c l e sp e ru n i te n t r o p y ,\nNi = ni\ns (2)\nis a conserved quantity which behaves like a comoving number density provided that particles\nare not being created or destroyed anymore. A useful application of this is to the number of\nbaryons. Provided that baryon number nonconserving interactions (if they even exist) are\noccuring very slowly then\nnB/s =( nB \u0000 n\u00afB)/s, (3)\nand so this ratio is a constant since the epoch of baryogenesis when the baryon assymmetry\nwas put in place.\nThe ratio of baryons to entropy is related to an important quantity that we will use in studies\nof both recombination and Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), which is the baryon to photon\nratio\n\u2318 = nB\nn\u0000\n(4)\nRecall that\ns = 2\u21e12\n45~3c3 g?S(T)(kBT)3 and n\u0000 = 2(kBT)3\u21e3(3)\n\u21e12~3c3 , (5)\nwhich implies\ns =1 .80g?S(T)n\u0000.

However, we know that sincee+ \u0000e\u0000 annihilation at around\nT \u21e0 500 keV, or about 4s after the Big Bang, the number of degrees of freedom has not\n2\nchanged and\ng?S(T . 500 keV) =\nphotons\nz}|{\n2+ 7\n8N\u232b(2g\u232b)\n\u2713T\u232b\nT\n\u25c63\n| {z }\nneutrinos/anti-neutrinos\n=2+ 7\n4 \u00b7 3 \u00b7 1 \u00b7 4\n11 =3 .91, (8)\nso we \ufb01nd that\n\u2318 ' 7nB\ns (9)\nis also a conserved quantity since that time.\nWe can calculate\u2318 as follows. Recalling that\n\u21e2\u00000 = 2(kBT0)4\u21e12\n30~3c3 , (10)\nwe use eqn. (5) above to write\nn\u00000\n\u21e2\u00000\n= 30\u21e3(3)\n\u21e14kBT0\n, (11)\nand therefore\n\u2318 = nB0\nn\u00000\n= \u21e2B0\nmpc2n\u00000\n= \u21e14kBT0\u21e2B0\n30\u21e3(3)mpc2\u21e2\u00000\n= \u21e14kBT0\u2326B0\n30\u21e3(3)mpc2\u2326\u00000\n=5 .5 \u21e5 10\u000010\n\u2713\u2326B0h2\n0.020\n\u25c6\n.

The \ufb01rst is the destruction of hydrogen atoms via\nthe photoelectric e\u21b5ect\nH+ \u0000 ! p + e\u0000, (13)\nwhich can occur if the photon\u0000 has an energyh\u232b > 13.6e V\u2318 BH.T h i s r e a c t i o n c a n a l s o\nrun in the opposite direction which is known asradiative recombination\np + e\u0000 ! H+ \u0000. (14)\nWhen does the recombination phase transition, and the consequent decoupling of photons\ntake place? We can obtain a quick and dirty estimate of the recombination temperature.\nOne might argue that recombination must take place when the mean energy per photon in\nthe cosmic microwave background falls below the ionization potential of the hydrogen atom,\nBH =1 3.6 eV. When this happens the average CMB photon is no longer able to photoionize\nhydrogen. Since the mean photon energy for a black body distribution isE ' 2.7kBT,t h i s\n3\nnaive argument would suggest a recombination temperature of\nTrec \u21e0 BH\n2.7kB\n\u21e0 60, 000 K) zrec \u21e0 20, 000. (15)\nBut we know the surface of last scattering is aroundzdec \u21e0 1100, so what did we do wrong\nhere? Obviously we ignored the fact that photons are not just at the mean temperature, but\nhave a distribution functinof(p). More importantly, this calculation neglects that photons\noutnumber baryons by a gigantic factor, namely\u2318\u00001 \u21e0 2\u21e5109.T h u s a n y n e w l y f o r m e d a t o m\nwill be surrounded by over a billion photons, and it is thus not the mean energy of those\nphotons that matters, but whether a photon in the extreme tail of the distribution is still\nenergetic enough to ionize hydrogen. Apparently the temperature actually needs to be much\nlower for atomic hydrogen to survive, such that even among\u21e0 2b i l l i o np h o t o n sp e rb a r y o n\nwe cannot \ufb01nd one photon energetic enough to ionize hydrogen. What we have learned is\nthat the recombination process, or more precisely the relative fraction of hydrogen which\nis ionized, has to depend on the baryon to photon ratio. Let\u2019s work out the mathematics\nbehind this using the equilibrium distribution functions that we have learned about.\nWe will make some simplifying assumptions here. First, we will assume the Universe is a\npure hydrogen plasma so that we don\u2019t need to worry about Helium nuclei. We will learn\nin the next lecture that the universe is actually\u21e0 10% Helium by number or about 25%\nHelium by mass, so this is not going to be a big correction, but it does simplify the math.\nSecond, and more important, we will calculate the fraction of the total hydrogen which is\nionized assuming LTE. This turns out to be a good approximation at early times, but then\nbreaks down as recombination proceeds, because the reactions above fall out of chemical\nequilibrium. We will work out the full non-equilibrium treatment next.\nOur goal is to follow thefree electron fractionor ionized fraction as a function of time\nXe \u2318 ne\nnp + nH\n= ne\nnB\n= np\nnB\n, (16)\nwhere our assumption of a pure hydrogen plasma impliesnB = np + nH and np = ne.\nConsider LTE between the electrons, protons, neutral atoms, and photons. In this case we\ncan write the reactions above as\np + e\u0000 $ H+ \u0000. (17)\nLTE implies that all particles obey the equilibrium distributions we derived previously, and\nthat we also have chemical equilibrium\n\u00b5p + \u00b5e = \u00b5H, (18)\nwhere we have used the fact that photons have zero chemical potential\u00b5\u0000 = 0. Now that\nwe are interested in chemical equilibrium, we need to retain the chemical potential in all the\ndistribution functions.\n4\nFigure 2: Free electron fraction as a function of redshift.

(25)\nFig. 2 shows the the redshift evolution of the free electron fraction as predicted both by the\nSaha equation above, and the more exact full non-equilibrium treatment using the Boltzmann\n(see below). The Saha approximation, which assumes LTE, correctly identi\ufb01es the onset of\nrecombination, but it is clearly insu\u0000cient if the aim is to determine the relic density of elec-\ntrons after freeze-out, since the Saha solution is just based on equilibrium thermodynamics\nand knows nothing about the reaction rate \u0000 relative to the Hubble time.\n1.3 Time of Recombination\nLet us de\ufb01ne the recombination temperatureTrec as the temperature whereXe =0 .1, that\nis when 90% of the electrons have combined with protons to form neutral hydrogen. This\nchoice is obviously somewhat arbitrary, but given that the Saha solution saysXe plummets\nexponentially, it won\u2019t matter much what we choose. Furthermore this is a regime where\nLTE still appears to be a reasonably valid assumption given the curves in Fig. 2. We \ufb01nd\nTrec \u21e1 3600 K' 0.3e V\nkB\n.

(29)\nSince we previously estimated that matter-radiation equality is atzeq ' 3500, we conclude\nthat recombination occurred in the matter-dominated era.

(31)\n1.4 Electron Freeze-Out\nIn Fig. 2 we see that a residual ionization fraction of electrons freezes out when the interac-\ntions in eqn. (17) become ine\u0000cient. To follow the free electron fraction after freeze-out, we\nneed to solve the Boltzmann equation, just as we did for the dark matter freeze-out. One\ncan obtain an order of magnitude estimate by applying the criterion\n\u0000(T)= neh\u0000vi\u21e0 H(T), (32)\nwhich you will do in the homework.

This is reasonably close to the true value, but\nslightly overestimated.\nThis residual abundance of electrons is important for two reasons. First, they are required\nto catalyze the formation of molecular hydrogen later on, and molecular hydrogen is crucial\nto cool gas to low enough temperatures so that the \ufb01rst stars can form. Second, as we will\nsee momentarily, the photons stop scattering o\u21b5 of the electrons just afer recombination.\nHowever, because the photon to baryon ratio is so high\u21e0 109,t h e s er a r es c a t t e r i n ge v e n t s\nbetween electrons and photons nevertheless continue to heat the electrons, which transfer this\nheat to the protons via Coulomb interactions. As a result, the temperature of the baryons\nremains coupled to that of the radiation and drops of asT / a\u00001, instead of theT / a\u00002\nthat a frozen out non-relativistic gas would usually follow in the absence of interactions.\nThus the temperature of the baryons follows the temperature of the CMB until much later\ntimes z \u21e0 150 than recombination/decoupling.\n9\n2 Photon Decoupling\nAs stated earlier, photons are most strongly coupled to the primordial plasma through their\nscattering interactions with electrons\ne\u0000 + \u0000 $ e\u0000 + \u0000, (49)\nwhich has an interaction rate given by\n\u0000\u0000 = ne\u0000T c = XenB\u0000T c (50)\nwhere \u0000T =6 .65 \u21e5 10\u000023 cm2 is the Thompson cross-section. Since \u0000\u0000 / ne,t h ei n t e r a c t i o n\nrate decreases as the density of free electrons drops. Photons and electrons decouple roughly\nwhen the interaction rate becomes smaller than the expansion rate,\n\u0000\u0000(Tdec) \u21e0 H(Tdec). (51)\nAgain using eqn.

(52)\nThe redshift of decouplingzdec is de\ufb01ned to be that for which \u0000\u0000/H = 1. Note that in the\nabove equation Xe is a function of redshift, which we have plotted in Fig. 2. One can see\nthat Xe drops abruptly during recombination, the factor of 113 in the equation above is\neasily overcome. For this reason recombination and decoupling happen at roughly the same\ntime.\nThe redshift and time of decoupling are\nzdec \u21e0 1090 (53)\ntdec \u21e0 380, 000 yr (54)\nAfter decoupling the photons stream freely. Observations of the cosmic microwave back-\nground today allow us to probe the conditions at last-scattering.\n10\nPhys 236: Cosmology\nLecture 9: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis\nLet us return toT \u21e0 1M e V .

Baryons are non-relativistic\nand therefore much fewer in number than the relativistic species as expressed by the ex-\ntremely small baryon to photon ratio\u2318 \u21e0 5 \u21e5 10\u000010. Nevertheless, we now want to study\nwhat happened to these trace amounts of baryonic matter. The total number of nucleons\nstays constant due to baryon number conservation. This baryon number can be in the form\nof protons and neutrons or heavier nuclei. Weak nuclear reactions may convert neutrons and\nprotons into each other and strong nuclear reactions may build nuclei from them. In this\nlecture, we will learn how the light elements \u2013 hydrogen\u2019s isotope deuterium, helium, and\nlithium were synthesized in the Big Bang. It turns out that the primordial synthesis of these\nelements provides one of the earliest and most stringest tests of the standard cosmology, and\nan important test of particle physics. As we will discuss, the present state of agreement be-\ntween theory and observation indicates that the standard cosmology is a valid description of\nthe universe at least back to times as early\u21e0 10\u00002 sec after the Big Bang and temperatures\nas high as\u21e0 10 MeV.\nIn its full generality, BBN is a very complicated process involving many coupled Boltzmann\nequations to track all the nuclear abundances, informed by collision strengths for all of the\nnuclear reactions. In practice, however, two simpli\ufb01cations will make our life much easier\n1. No elements heaver than helium.\nFor reasons that we will explain, essentially no elements heavier than helium are pro-\nduced at appreciable levels. So the only nuclei that we need to track are hydrogen and\nhelium, and their isotopes: deuterium, tritium, and3He.\n2. Only neutrons and protons above 0.1 MeV.\nAbove T \u21e1 0.1 MeV only free protons and neutrons exist, while other light nuclei\nhaven\u2019t been formed yet. Therefore, we can \ufb01rst solve for the neutron/proton ratio\nand then use this abundance as the initial conditions for the synthesis of deuterium,\nhelium, etc.\nAt some level the zeroth order goal of this lecture is to provide a theoretical explanation for\none number: the ratio of the density of helium to hydrogen\nnHe\nnH\n' 1\n16 or by mass Y = \u21e2(4He)\n\u21e2B\n' 1\n4 (1)\n1 Lightning Introduction to Nuclear Physics\nA single proton is a hydrogen nucleus, referred to as\n1H or simply p;( 2 )\n1\nAp r o t o na n dan e u t r o nm a k eu pd e u t e r i u m :\n2Ho r D. (3)\nOne proton and two neutrons make tritium:\n3Ho r T. (4)\nNuclei with two protons are helium; these can have\none neutron: 3He or two neutrons: 4He. (5)\nThus unique elements have a \ufb01xed number ofZ protons, and isotopes of a given element\nhave di\u21b5ering numbers of neutrons. The total number of nucleons, i.e. neutrons and protons,\nin the nucleus, is known as theatomic numberor mass numberA,w h i c hi sl i s t e da sa\nsuperscript before the name of the element.\nThe total mass of a nucleus withZ protons andA\u0000Z neutrons di\u21b5ers slightly from the mass\nof the individual protons and neutrons alone. This di\u21b5erence is called the binding energy,\nde\ufb01ned as\nBA = Zmpc2 +( A \u0000 Z)mnc2 \u0000 mAc2, (6)\nwhere mp and mn are the mass of the proton and neutron, respectively, andmA is the mass\nof the nucleus. For example, the mass of deuterium is 1875.62 MeV while the sum of the\nneutron and proton masses is 1877.84 MeV, so the binding energy of deuterium is 2.22 MeV.\nAlthough the nucleons have\u21e0 GeV mass energy, nuclear binding energies are typically in\nthe MeV range, which explains why Big Bang nucleosynthesis occurs at temperatures a bit\nless than 1 MeV.\nThe binding energyBA of a nucleus is the energy required to pull it apart into its component\nprotons and neutrons. Equivalently, it is the energy released when a nucleus is fused together\nfrom individual protons and neutrons. I \ufb01nd it helpful to consider the analogy with ionization\nand recombination processes, which are typically more familiar. For example, we just studied\nthe reaction\np+ + e\u0000 $ H+ \u0000 (7)\nwhere \u0000 is a photon, and we know that photon energies in excess of the binding energy\nBH =1 3.6 eV are required to ionize hydrogen.\nThis can be compared to the reaction which synthesizes deuterium\np+ + n $ D+ \u0000, (8)\nwhere in order to break D we require a gamma ray photon \u0000 more energetic than the\nbinding energy of Deuterium BD =2 .22 MeV. The deuteron is in fact not very tightly\nbound compared to other atomic nuclei. Fig. 1 plots the binding energy per necleuonBA/A\nfor atomic nuclei with di\u21b5erent mass numbers. Note that4He has a very highBA/A =7 . 0 7\nor total binding energyBA =2 8.30 MeV making it relatively tightly bound compared to\nother light nuclei withA \uf8ff 10. The most tightly bound nuclei are those of56Fe, 58Fe, and\n2\n61Ni. Thus nuclei less massive than iron or nickel can release energy by fusion \u2013 merging\ninto heavier nuclei. Whereas nuclei more massive than iron or nickel can release energy by\n\ufb01ssion \u2013 splitting into lighter nuclei.\nFinally, we will quantify abundances of the light elements via the mass fraction of a nuclear\nspecies A(Z),\nXA = nAA\nnB\n; nB = nn + np +\nX\nA\nAnA, (9)\nwhere P\nA XA =1a n dnB = \u2318n\u0000 is the total number density of baryons (whether bound or\nfree) and\u2318 is the baryon-to-photon ratio.\nTable 1: Binding Energies of Light Elements\nAZB A gA kBTnuc\n2H2 . 2 2 M e V30 . 0 7 M e V\n3H6 . 9 2 M e V2\n3He 7.72 MeV 2 0.11 MeV\n4He 28.3 MeV 1 0.28 MeV\n12C9 2 . 2 M e V 1 0 . 2 5 M e V\nTable 2: Binding energies BA for light elements. Note that kBTnuc is the temperature at\nwhich NSE predicts an order unity abundance given the universe\u2019s very small baryon to\nphoton ratio\u2318.\n2 Nuclear Statisitcal Equilibrium\nSimilar to our approach when discussing recombination, we will \ufb01rst derive the equilbrium\nabundances of several relevant species, and then consider how these equilbrium abundances\ndi\u21b5er from the full non-equilibrium treatment using the Boltzmann equation, which correctly\ndescribes what happens when \u0000\u21e0 H.\n2.1 Neutrons\nFirst let\u2019s consider neutrons and protons which constitute the basic building blocks for\nnucleosynthesis.

For electrons, you showed in the homework that this results\nfrom the charge neutrality of the universe and the extremely small baryon to photon ratio.\nFor neutrinos this is an assumption that is very likely to be true1.\nThus we see that forT \u0000 1 MeV, there are as many neutrons as protons. However, for\nT< 1 MeV, the neutron fraction is exponentially suppressed as shown in Fig. 2. Recall\nthat Q =( mn \u0000 mp)c2 \u2318 1.30 MeV, thus protons are the lower energy \u2018bound state\u2019, and\nas the universe cools down it is not energetically favorable to have any neutrons around.\nThis is exactly the same principle behind forming the \ufb01rst atoms during recombination,\ni.e. the bound state H is energetically preferred once you cool down enough. If the weak\ninteractions would operate e\u0000ciently enough to maintain equilibrium inde\ufb01nitely, then the\nneutron abundance would drop to zero. Luckily, in the real world the weak interactions are\nnot so e\u0000cient. To get the \ufb01nal \u201cfreeze-out\u201d abundancenn/np we will need to do a full\nnon-equilibrium Boltzmann calculation, which we will come to momentarily.\n2.2 Deuterium\nNow let\u2019s consider deuterium,2H, an isotope of hydrogen with one proton and one neutron.\nBBN takes place through a series of two-body reactions, building heavier nuclei step by step.\nThe essential \ufb01rst step is the fusion of a proton and neutron to form a deuteron\np+ + n $ D+ \u0000. (15)\nFor the present calculation we will take the input neutron abundance to be a \ufb01xed initial\ncondition, which is a reasonable assumption given that the freeze-out neutron abundance is\nset in place before deuterium synthesis begins (see Fig. 2).\nNote again that the deuterium reaction has exactly the same form as the recombination-\nphotoionization reaction\np+ + e\u0000 $ H+ \u0000. (16)\nIn that context, we derived the Saha equation\nnH\nnpne\n=\n\u2713 2\u21e1~2\nmekBT\n\u25c63/2\nexp\n\u2713 BH\nkBT\n\u25c6\n, (17)\nwhich states that neutral hydrogen is favored in the limitkBT ! 0, whereas ionized hydrogen\nis favored in the limitkBT !1 .\nIn analogy with our procedure for recombination, the assumption of chemical equilibrium\nfor deuterium\n\u00b5p + \u00b5n = \u00b5D, (18)\n1The exact same calculation that you performed in the homework applies to neutrinos, implying\u00b5\u232b/\nkBT \u21e0 (n\u232b \u0000n\u00af\u232b)/n\u0000. However, since the relic neutrino background has not been directly detected we cannot\nuse the charge neutrality argument to estimate the di\u21b5erence in the numbers of particles to anti-particles as\nwe did for the electron. So we are implicitly assuming that similar to the small Baryon numbernB \u0000n \u00afB the\nuniverse also has a small lepton number and thus (n\u232b \u0000 n\u00af\u232b)/n\u0000 \u2327 1.\n6\nimplies the relative numbers of free protons, free neutrons, and deuterons are given by a\ncompletely analogous equation\nnD\nnpnn\n= gD\ngngp\n\u2713 mD\nmpmn\n\u25c63/2 \u27132\u21e1~2\nkBT\n\u25c63/2\nexp\n\uf8ff(mp + mn \u0000 mD)c2\nkBT\n\u0000\n=6\n\u2713 \u21e1~2\nmnkBT\n\u25c63/2\nexp\n\u2713 BD\nkBT\n\u25c6\n,\n(19)\nwhere in the last equality we used the de\ufb01nition of the binding energy of deuterium\nBD \u2318 (mp + mn \u0000 mD)c2 =2 .22 MeV, (20)\nplugged in the degeneracy factor for the deuteron (spin= 1,gD =3 ) ,t h ep r o t o na n dn e u t r o n\n(gp = gn =2 ) ,a n da g a i nu s e dt h ea p p r o x i m a t i o nmp \u21e1 mn \u21e1 mD/2i nt h em a s sr a t i oi n\nthe pre-factor. Thus we end up with an equation equivalent to the Saha equation which\ndescribes nuclear statistical equilibrium(NSE). Similar to electron/protons vs. atoms,\nwe see that there should be no deuterium (bound state) in the limit ofkBT !1 ,b u t\ndeuterium is favored in the limitkBT ! 0.\nSimilar to our approach for recombination, let\u2019s obtain an estimate for the temperature\nTnuc at which deuterium becomes favored. To do this we will de\ufb01ne the time of \u201cdeuterium\nsynthesis\u201d to be atnD/nB \u21e0 1, when the deuterium abundance is a number of order unity. In\nthe next section we will learn that the freeze-out neutron abundance when neutrons decouple\n(before deuterium synthesis) is\nnn/nB = 1\n6 or np =0 .83nB (21)\nand even today' 75% of all baryons in the universe are in the form of unbound protons.\nSo we can approximiately takenn ' nB/6a n dnp ' nB which gives\nnD\nnB\n\u21e1 nB\n\u2713 \u21e1~2\nmpkBT\n\u25c63/2\nexp\n\u2713 BD\nkBT\n\u25c6\n, (22)\nwhere we substitutedmnc2 \u21e1 mpc2 =9 3 8.3 MeV. Similar to our approach for recombination\nwe can express the baryon density in terms of the baryon to photon ratio\nnB = \u2318n\u0000 = \u2318 \u21e5 2(kBT)3\u21e3(3)\n\u21e12~3c3 , (23)\nand we \ufb01nally obtain\nXD \u2318 nD\nnB\n\u21e1 \u2318\n\u2713 kBT\nmpc2\n\u25c63/2\nexp\n\u2713 BD\nkBT\n\u25c6\n, (24)\nNot surprisingly, this equation has the exact same form as our equation for the ionized\nfraction Xe during recombination.\nAs long asBD/T is not too large, the pre-factor\u2318 dominates this expression. Recall that\nthis pre-factor is extremely small becuase of the small\u2318 ' 5.5 \u21e5 10\u000010 baryon to photon\nratio. As the temperature drops, bound states like deuterium (or neutral atoms) become\n7\nenergetically favored.

(26)\nThe reason whykBTnuc is a factor of\u21e0 30 lower than the binding energy is again because of\nthe extremely large number of photons to baryons, which can be seen in the equation above.\nIndeed, the temperature is only logarithimically sensitive to\u2318,b u tb e c a u s e\u2318 is so small this\nnevertheless has a signi\ufb01cant e\u21b5ect on the temperature at which we can form deuterium.\nJust like in the case of recombination, the interpretation is that because photons outnumber\nbaryons by such a gigantic factor, there are many high energy photons than can immediately\ndestroy nuclei that are formed when the temperature is around the binding energy. In order\nfor it to be energetically favorable to form bound states like deuterium, we need to lower the\ntemperature enough such that even the photons in the high-energy tail of the distribution\nare not abundant enough to inhibit deuterium production.\nThis is what is known as thedeuterium bottleneck.A t o m i c n u c l e i a r e b u i l t u p s e q u e n t i a l l y\nfrom lighter elements via two-body reactions. This implies that helium nuclei cannot be\nformed directly from neutrons and protons, because the densities are too low and the time\navailable is too short for reactions involving three or more incoming nuclei to occur at an\nappreciable rate. The small baryon to photon ratio inhibits the production of deuterium\nuntil the temperature drops well beneath its nuclear binding energy. At temperatures above\n0.1 MeV, then, virtually all baryons are in the form of neutrons and protons. Around this\ntime, deuterium (and then immediately helium) are produced, but the reaction rates are by\nthis time too low to produce any heavier elements. We will come back to this point when\nwe discuss full non-equilibrium solutions.\n2.3 General Treatment\nGiven a nuclear species with mass numberA = n + p and chargeZ = p,w h e r en =n u m b e r\nof neutrons andp= number of protons in the nucleus, its equilibrium number density is given\nby:\nnA = gA\n\u2713mAkBT\n2\u21e1~2\n\u25c63/2\nexp\n\u2713\u00b5A \u0000 mA\nT\n\u25c6\n. (27)\nIf nuclear reactions occur at a rate higher than the expansion rateH,t h e nc h e m i c a le q u i l i b -\nrium is obtained. Although the weak force can convert protons into neutrons and vice versa,\nthe total number of baryons is conserved in all of the interactions we will be concerned with\nhere. This allows us to relate the chemical potential for the nucleus to that of protons and\nneutrons through:\n\u00b5A = Z\u00b5p +( A \u0000 Z)\u00b5n . (28)\n8\nWe can divide eqn.

Note that the equi-\nlibrium abundances of all bound nuclei are negligible as long as free neutrons and protons\nare in equilibrium due to the small\u2318 factor.\nFigure 3: The NSE mass fractions of all nuclear species withZ \uf8ff 6, for a neutron-to-proton\nratio of 0.14. If the universe had expanded arbitrarily slowly, allowing all nuclear processes to\nreach equilibrium, then the vast majority of the protons and neutrons would become bound\ninto helium-4 nuclei, and later into carbon-12. Figure from Hooper.\n10\nBy taking the natural log of the general expression forXA in eqn. (32), we \ufb01nd that theXA\nwill be of order unity at temperatures satisfying\nTnuc ' BA/(A \u0000 1)\nln (\u2318\u00001)+1 .5l n(mpc2/kBT), (35)\nwhich is the generalization of eqn. (35) for deuterium. We see that NSE predicts that\nTnuc =0 .07 MeV for deuterium,Tnuc =0 .11 MeV for3He, Tnuc =0 .28 MeV for4He, and\nTnuc =0 .25 MeV for12C. These values are listed in Table 2.\nFor the sake of illustration, consider the following system of light elements withZ \uf8ff 6:\nneutrons, protons, deuterons, tritium, 3He nuclei, 4He nuclei, and the istopes of C,12C,\n13C, and 14C nuclei. A solution to the NSE system of equations in eqn. (34) is shown in\nFig. 3. We can clearly see that although the binding energies per nucleon are of the order\nof 1 to 8 MeV (see Table 2), the equilibrium abundance of nuclear species does not become\nof order unity until a temperature of order 0.3 MeV. This is due to the high entropy of the\nUniverse, that is, the very small value of\u2318. Although for temperatures less than a few MeV\nnuclei are favored on energetic grounds, entropy considerations (i.e. the extremely small\nbaryon-to-photon ratio\u2318) favor free nucleons, and the entropy of the Universe is very high.\nAnother important thing to note from this simple example and eqn. (32) is that in NSE the\nmost bound heavy elements are favored as the temperature is decreased (which would be\nlate times). This simple illustrative calculation was cuto\u21b5 at CarbonZ =6 ,a n dw es e et h a t\nif the universe had expanded arbitrarily slowly, allowing all nuclear processes adequate time\nto reach equilibrium, then the vast majority of the protons and neutrons would \ufb01rst become\nbound into helium-4 nuclei, and later into carbon-12. These two isotopes each stand out in\npart because of their high binding energies per nucleon (see Table 2 and Fig. 1).\nHad we extended this calculation to heavier elements we would \ufb01nd that they dominate\nat progressively later times. Indeed, NSE predicts that the end state of the nulceosynthesis\nshould be that all the material in the Universe should be in some iron nickel alloy, since these\nare the most bound heavy elements from Fig. 1. The reason why (fortunately!), this did not\noccur in reality is that the Universe departs from NSE. The important thing to note is that\nNSE knows nothing about reaction rates or our criteria \u0000\u0000 H. When we assume NSE, we\nassume that the Universe has enough time to arrive at thermal and chemical equilbrium, and\nthe relative abundances of states simply depend on their relative energies and the relative\nnumbers of particles (e.g. photons to baryons). In the next section, we consider the non-\nequilibrium calculation that is required to determine the freeze-out abundance of neutrons.\n3 Neutron Freeze Out\nIn this section we want to solve for the non-equilibrium neutron-proton ratio that constitutes\nthe initial conditions for BBN. As we see in eqns. (10) weak interactions convert protons\ninto neutrons, and these reactions stay in equilibrium atT & 3M e V . A t l a t e r t i m e s ( l o w e r\ntemperatures) one must use the Boltzmann equation to track the neutron abundance.

The \ufb01rst\nnucleus to form is therefore deuterium\nn + p $ D+ \u0000. (56)\nOnly when there is enough deuterium can the production of helium in signi\ufb01cant numbers\ncommence via reactions like\nD+ p $ 3He +\u0000\nD+ 3He $ 4He +p (57)\nBecause of thedeuterium bottleneck,w h i c hi st os a yt h a td e u t e r i u mp r o d u c t i o ni sd e l a y e d\nuntil Tnuc ' 0.07 MeV (t =2 7 0 s ) ,h e l i u mp r o d u c t i o nt h u sh a st ow a i tf o rd e u t e r i u m . S i n c e\nthe binding energy of helium is larger than that of deuterium (see Table 2), the Boltzmann\nfactor eB/kBT (see eqn. 32) favors helium over deuterium. Indeed, in Fig. 2 we see that helium\nis produced almost immediately after deuterium begins to form. Thus virtually all of the\nremaining neutrons atT = Tnuc (t = tnuc)a r ep r o c e s s e di n t o4He. Since two neutrons go\ninto one nucleus of4He, the \ufb01nal4He number density is equal to half of the neutron density\nat Tnuc,i . e .n4He = nn(Tnuc)/2, so we can write\nY \u2318 X4He = 4n4He\nnB\n' 4nn/2\nnn + np\n=2 Xn(Tnuc) ' 2 \u21e5 0.12 = 0.24, (58)\nwhich is in agreement with the observed value ofY = 1\n4 discussed at the beginning of class.\nFig. 6 shows the result of a full numerical non-equilibrium solution to the coupled Boltzmann\n15\nFigure 5: Time and temperature evolution of all standard big bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN)-\nrelevant nuclear abundances.

Figure from Pospelov\n& Pradler 2010, ARNP 60:539-68\nequations for a network of light elements, which includes other heavy elements like6Li, and\n7Be. Why wasn\u2019t12C or other heavy elements synthesized in the Big Bang like a naive NSE\ncalculation (see Fig. 3) might suggest? The answer is threefold:\nDeuterium bottleneck The extremely small baryon to photon ratio implies that\nwaiting for deuterium production delays the formation of the \ufb01rst nuclei toTnuc =\n0.07 MeV. By this time the two body reaction rates are too low to produce any heavier\nelements in signi\ufb01cant numbers.\nHelium is exceptionally tightly boundInspection of Fig. 1 illustrates that4He\nconstitutes a local maximum in the binding energy per nucleon. Recall that the Boltz-\n16\nmann factor eB/kBT determines which bound states are preferred. The large binding\nenergy of Helium means it can stick around as the preferred bound state for a long\ntime e\u21b5ectively terminiating BBN, because by the time the universe would be cool\nenough to prefer more tightly bound states the reaction rates are already too low and\neverything is frozen out.\nLack of a stable istopesGlancing at Fig. 1 we see that there are no stable isotopes\nwith atomic numberA =5o r A =8 . E x o t i ci s o t o p e sl i k e5He, 5Li, or 8Be are wildly\nunstable with extremely short half-lives. This means once 4He is created, heavier\nelements cannot be produced via a reaction like\n4He +p !5 X. (59)\nWhat about the fusion of two or more4He nuclei? In massive stars, with core tem-\nperatures above 0.01 MeV, helium can fuse into carbon via the so-called triple alpha\nprocess\n4He +4He !8 Be (60)\nfollowed by\n8Be +4He ! 12C+2 \u0000. (61)\nThe fact that8Be is unstable with a very short lifetime, however, makes this process\nvery slow. It is e\u21b5ective over the lifetime of a star, but not within the few minutes\navailable for BBN. More generally, the lack of any stable nuclei withA =5o r A =8\nand the fact that densities are too low and time available too short (set by the Hubble\nexpansion) to allow three nuclei to \ufb01nd one another implies heavier elements are not\ncreated in signi\ufb01cant numbers.\n5 Observations and Constraints on the Standard Model\n5.1 Observations of Primordial Abundances\nThe challenge of using observations to compare with BBN is that the early universe is not the\nonly place where the number of elements are changed: nucleosynthesis in stars forms heavy\nelements and can burn up primordial light elements. Nonetheless we can often tell when\nthis is a problem, because heavy elements are only produced in signi\ufb01cant numbers in stars,\nso places where we see many heavy elements are clearly contaminated. Instead constraints\ncan be placed by looking for low metallicity systems \u2013 those with few heavy elements so\nthat the observed abundances may better re\ufb02ect the primordial abundances (\u201cmetals\u201d in\nastrophysics are all the elements except hydrogen and helium). If the metallicity dependence\nof the abundance of interest can be judged, it may also be possible to extrapolate from\nobservations to zero metallicity, even though we see no entirely uncontaminated systems.\nDeuterium:M e a s u r e m e n t s o f t h e p r i m o r d i a l d e u t e r i u m a b u n d a n c e a r e p e r h a p s o u r\nsingle most powerful probe of the universe during its \ufb01rst few minutes. A major\nchallenge in these determinations is the small binding energy of deuterium, which\n17\nmakes it easily destroyed in stars. Strictly speaking, this means that any measurement\nof D/H is technically a lower-limit on the primordial abundance. This can be remedied\nby measuring the deuterium abundance in regions devoid of metals and hence with little\nevidence of destruction by stellar nucleosynthesis. For this we rely on observations of\nhigh-redshift (i.e. very early) environments. In this regard, damped Lyman-\u21b5 systems\nare particularly useful. Damped Lyman-\u21b5 systems are dense regions in high-redshift\ngalaxies, for which it is possible to use precision spectroscopy to measure the hydrogen\nand deuterium column densities. At present, only a handful of such measurements have\nbeen made, but these have been used to precisely determine (e.g. arXiv:1710.11129)\n(D/H)p =2 .527 \u00b10.030 \u21e510\u00005;w h e r et h ep subscript indicates we are referring to the\nprimordial value of this ratio. The measured value of this quantity doesn\u2019t show any\ncorrelation with redshift or metallicity (a measure of past star formation), supporting\nthe conclusion that these measurements re\ufb02ect the true primordial value. In contrast,\nmeasurements of the relative deuterium abundance in the Solar System and in the\nMilky Way show considerable variation, which is anti-correlated with the presence of\nmetals, indicative of the impact of stellar processing.\nHelium-4: This is a very strongly bound nucleus, so it is not destroyed by stellar\nprocesses, but is produced in stars together with other elements: the observed abun-\ndance should be larger than the primordial one. The primordial helium mass fraction,\nYp,i sm o s te \u21b5 e c t i v e l yd e t e r m i n e dt h r o u g ht h em e a s u r e m e n t so fh e l i u ma n dh y d r o g e n\nemission lines from very low metallicity regions of partially ionized gas. These mea-\nsurements reveal a correlation between the4He abundance and the presence of metals\nin the system, indicating contamination of helium produced through fusion in stars.\nExtrapolating this relationship to zero metallicity results in a determination (from\narXiv:1112.3713) YP =0 .253 \u00b1 0.01 which compares well with the BBN prediction of\naround 0.248 for Planck baryon density parameters.\nHelium-3: Determinations of the primordial abundance of helium-3 have proven dif-\n\ufb01cult.

For this reason, most modern\nBBN analyses do not make use of any measurements of3He.\nLithium:L i t h i u m a b u n d a n c e s a r e m o s t r e a d i l y d e t e r m i n e d b y s p e c t r o s c o p i c m e a s u r e -\nments of low-metallicity dwarf stars.

The other measurements\nthen provide a highly non-trivial consistency check on BBN predictions. They also constrain\nthe number of additional light neutrinos or any other contribution to the energy densities at\nvery high redshifts that would have changed the expansion rate during BBN.\nThe value of\u2318 that is observed, giving \u2326b ' 0.05, is broadly consistent with independent\nmeasurements at a redshift ofz \u21e0 1100 from the anisotropies in the CMB. Once \u2326b or \u2318\nis \ufb01xed, we can then test observations of other abundances against the BBN predictions.\nThese are broadly consistent for deuterium and helium-4. For lithium, observations suggest\nlithium is present at the order of magnitude predicted by BBN, but in detail signi\ufb01cantly\nless is observed than we\u2019d expect; this is sometimes called the \u2018lithium problem\u2019 (see e.g.\narXiv:1203.3551). Understanding whether this represents a problem interpreting the data\n\u2013t h i sm i g h th a v et od ow i t ht h ed e p l e t i o no fl i t h i u mi ns t a r s\u2013o rw h e t h e rs t a n d a r dB B N\nneeds to be modi\ufb01ed (either resonant nuclear interactions that have not been included in\nthe numerical codes, or new physics), is an open question.\nThe predicted abundances of light elements in BBN as a function of\u2318 (or equivalently \u2326B)\nare plotted in Fig. 6 (from a numerical code that evolves the full hierarchy of interaction\nequations). The fact that we \ufb01nd reasonably good quantitative agreement with observations\nis one of the great triumphs of the Big Bang model.\n5.2 BBN Predctions and Testing the Standard Model\nThe primordial abundances of light elements depends on the following parameters:\nNeutron lifetime: which is used to express the rate of the weak interactions. Nowa-\ndays, this is pretty well-known. If\u2327n were larger, for example, then we would have a\nsmaller interaction rate, which would imply a larger neutron freeze-out temperature\nand larger neutron-to-proton ratio, and therefore a larger4He abundance.\nBaryon-to-photon ratio\u2318:T h e m a s s f r a c t i o n f o r t h e n u c l e a r s p e c i e s i s p r o p o r t i o n a l\nto this parameter, so the smaller\u2318 is, the smallerXA (photon-destruction of formed\nnuclei remains e\u21b5ective until lower temperatures when there are more photons per\nbaryon). A higher\u2318 means that the mass fractions for the deuterium, tritium and3He\nbuild up earlier, so that the synthesis of4He is more e\u0000cient, we get more helium and\nless is left of the lighter nuclei. This number can be constrained both from comparison\nof BBN predictions with data, and also independently through the detailed shape of\nthe spectrum of anisotropies in the CMB.\nE\u21b5ective number of relativistic degrees of freedom:o r e q u i v a l e n t l y , t h e t o t a l\nenergy density at the time of BBN.

Figure from\nBaumann.\nAn extra relativistic degree of freedom means more energy density in radiation, and a\nlarger expansion rate. Therefore, the Universe will be younger at a given temperature,\ni.e. the pre-factor in eqn. 53 would be smaller. This means that the time between\n20\nthe temperature when neutrinos freeze-out and the temperatureTnuc when deuterium\nstarts forming would be shorter, and there would thus be less time for neutrons to\ndecay (see e.g. eqn. 54). The neutron-to-proton ratio is therefore larger at the on-\nset of nucleosynthesis and so is the \ufb01nal primordial helium abundance. Observations\nconstrain the extra number of neutrino families to be less than one.\n21"

                "Content": "Phys 236: Cosmology\nLecture 12-13: Linear Structure Formation\nNow that we have established how to statistically describe density \ufb02uctuations in the universe\nwe will study how some initial set of \ufb02uctuations grow and evolve with time because of grav-\nitational instability. In its full generality this is a very complex and technical task. There are\nseveral reasons for this complexity. First, the di\ufb00erential equations that describe structure\nformation are non-linear which means that they will not admit simple analytical solutions,\nand furthermore the systems evolve chaotically. The remedy for this is straighforward \u2013 one\ncan always resort to numerical calulations.\nNon-linear evolution is however unfortunately not the only complication. To fully solve for\nthe evolution of structure Newtonian gravity will not su\ufb03ce, and one needs to use the full\nmachinery of general relativity. There are several reasons for this. The \ufb01rst is that, as we\nlearned beore, all forms of mass energy can gravitate, and so to properly treat \ufb02uctuations\nin the relativistic components we need GR. Even more subtle and complicated are issues\nrelated to causality and the presence of horizons, which clearly requires GR since Newtonian\ngravity would imply action-at-a-distance. Although Newtonian analysis provides valuable\ninsight into the behavior of inhomogeneities, it su\ufb00ers from the following di\ufb03culty. As we\nwill learn, at su\ufb03ciently early epochs the wavelengths \u03bb of density \ufb02uctuation modes that\nwe will need to consider will lie outside of the particle horizon rph. Newtonian analysis is\nonly valid for later times when wavelength of the \ufb02uctuations are much smaller than the\nparticle horizon \u03bb \u226arph. Thus the early evolution of any mode needs to be tackled using\nthe full machinery in GR.\nOne of the main challenges with studying the growth of inhomogenities in GR is the question\nof gauge freedom. Qualitatively, you can think of the choice of a gauge as choosing a\ncoordinate system. For modes much smaller than the horizon, there exists a natural choice\nof coordinates in which GR looks like Newtonian gravity, adhering to our physical intuition.\nHowever, for super-horizon modes this is not the case, and for technical reasons one cannot\nwork in this quasi-Newtonian gauge. These gauge/coordinate ambiguities make the full\ntreatment in GR a rather daunting task.\nThe full GR treatment is thus beyond the scope of this course. In this set of lectures we will\nrestrict attention to the Newtonian treatment in the linear regime \u03b4(x) \u226a1, which allows us\nto linearize the di\ufb00erential equations, allowing us to obtain analytical results in a few cases.\nIn a future lecture, we will discuss evolution of density \ufb02uctuations in the non-linear regime.\n1 Jeans Instability\nBefore treating an expanding universe, let\u2019s start by building our intuition by studying\nthe growth of preturbations due to gravitational instability in a static nonexpanding uni-\nverse. Thus we consider a homogenous isotropic background density of matter with time-\n1\nindependent density \u03c10(r,t) = const. The evolution equations for a perfect \ufb02uid are\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202t + \u2207\u00b7(\u03c1v) = 0 (continuity) (1)\n\u2202v\n\u2202t + (v \u00b7\u2207)v = \u2212\u2207P\n\u03c1 \u2212\u2207\u03a6 (Euler) (2)\n\u22072\u03a6 = 4\u03c0G\u03c1 (Poisson). (3)\nThese equations express conservation of mass-energy (continuity), conservation of momen-\ntrum (Euler), and gravity (Poisson), respectively. They amount to \ufb01ve equations in six\nunknowns (\u03c1, v, P, \u03a6), so they must be supplemented by another equation. Similar to our\nderivation of the Friedmann equation, we must supplement these equations with an equation\nof state P = P(\u03c1). Actually the most general form would be to assume P = P(\u03c1,S), where\nS is the entropy, but we will assume the entropy is \ufb01xed, \u03b4S = 0, which is to say we will\nonly consider isentropic perturbations 1 .\nWe consider small preturbations about a homogenous solution\n\u03c1(r,t) = \u03c10 + \u03b4\u03c1(r,t)\nP(r,t) = P0 + \u03b4P(r,t)\nv(r,t) = v0 + \u03b4v = \u03b4v(r,t)\n\u03a6(r,t) = \u03a60 + \u03b4\u03a6(r,t), (4)\nwhere the terms with zero subscript are constants, we have assumed v0 = 0, and \u03b4\u03c1 \u226a\u03c10,\netc. Using the equation of state, the pressure perturbation can be written\n\u03b4P = c2\ns\u03b4\u03c1, c 2\ns \u2261\n(\u2202P\n\u2202\u03c1\n)\nS\n(5)\nwhere cs is the sound speed.\nNote that as constructed this set of equations has some serious problems. If the \ufb02uid is to\nremain homogenous with constant density \u03c1 then we must also have F \u221d\u2207\u03a60 = 0, or else\nthere would be a net gravitational force. But this implies that \u22072\u03a60 = 4\u03c0G\u03c10 = 0 as well, so\nthe gas is not actually there! This means that there can be no homogenous self-gravitating\n\ufb02uid in equilibrium. For now we will simply ignore this complication and assume that such\na solution with \u22072\u03a60 = 4\u03c0G\u03c10 does exist, since it turns out to give a useful physical picture\nanyway. This is what is commonly referred to as the Jeans swindle.\nSubstituting eqns. (4) into the continuity equation (eqn. 1) and gathering terms that are\n1Entropy perturbations can occur only in multi-component \ufb02uids. For example, in a \ufb02uid consisting of\nbaryons and radiation, the baryons can be distributed inhomogeneously on a homogeneous background of\nradiation. In such a case, the entropy, which is equal to the number of photons per baryon, varies from place\nto place. In general there are two types of perturbations \u2013 isentropic perturbations for which \u03b4S = 0 (and\n\u03b4\u03c1\u0338= 0), and so-called isocurvature pertubrations, which have \u03b4\u03c1= 0 (\u03b4S \u0338= 0).\n2\nzeroth, \ufb01rst, and second-order in products of perturbed quantities gives\n\u2202\u03c10\n\u2202t + \u2207\u00b7(\u03c10v0)\n\ued19 \ued18\ued17 \ued1a\n0th-order\n+ \u2202\u03b4\u03c1\n\u2202t + \u2207\u00b7(\u03c10\u03b4v) + \u2207\u00b7(\u03b4\u03c1v0)\n\ued19 \ued18\ued17 \ued1a\n1st-order\n+ \u2207\u00b7(\u03b4\u03c1\u03b4v)\ued19 \ued18\ued17 \ued1a\n2nd-order\n. (6)\nHere the 0th-order terms concern the homogenous unperturbed universe. In this static case\nthey are trivially zero, since we have assumed a constant background, but in the future when\nwe perturb about an expanding homogenous and isotropic background they will be satis\ufb01ed\nby the unperturbed (zero subscript) terms. Keeping only linear order in perurbed quantities,\nthat is, ignoring the second order terms, we obtain for the perturbed continuity equation\n\u2202\u03b4\u03c1\n\u2202t + \u03c10\u2207\u00b7\u03b4v, (7)\nwhere we used the fact thatv0 = 0. Applying this same procedure to all of the \ufb02uid equations\nin eqns. (1)-(3) gives\n\u2202\u03b4\u03c1\n\u2202t = \u2212\u03c10\u2207\u00b7\u03b4v, (continuity) (8)\n\u2202\u03b4v\n\u2202t = \u2212c2\ns\n\u03c10\n\u2207\u03b4\u03c1\u2212\u2207\u03b4\u03a6 (Euler) (9)\n\u22072\u03b4\u03a6 = 4\u03c0G\u03b4\u03c1. (Poisson) (10)\nTaking the divergence of eqn. (9), and using the continuity eqn. (8) and Poisson eqn. (10)\nto express \u2207\u00b7\u03b4v and \u22072\u03b4\u03a6 in terms of \u03b4\u03c1, we \ufb01nally obtain\n\u22022\u03b4\u03c1\n\u2202t2 \u2212c2\ns\u22072\u03b4\u03c1\u22124\u03c0G\u03c10\u03b4\u03c1= 0. (11)\nThis is a closed linear wave equation for the perurbed density \u03b4\u03c1. It has two driving terms\n\u22022\u03b4\u03c1\n\u2202t2 = 4\u03c0G\u03c10\u03b4\u03c1\ued19 \ued18\ued17 \ued1a\ngravity\n+ c2\ns\u22072\u03b4\u03c1\ued19 \ued18\ued17 \ued1a\npressure\n, (12)\nwhich re\ufb02ect the competetition between gravitational forces that promote collapse, and pres-\nsure forces which oppose collapse.\nNoting that the coe\ufb03cients in the equation above are constants which do not depend on\nposition, we can thus express \u03b4\u03c1 in terms of its Fourier transform\n\u03b4\u03c1(r,t) =\n\u222b d3k\n(2\u03c0)3 \u03b4\u03c1(k,t)eik\u00b7r, (13)\nand plug into eqn. (11) to obtain a set of ordinary di\ufb00erential equations for the time-\ndependent Fourier coe\ufb03cients \u03b4\u03c1(k,t):\n\u03b4\u00a8\u03c1(k,t) + (k2c2\ns \u22124\u03c0G\u03c10)\u03b4\u03c1(k,t) = 0, (14)\n3\nwhere dot denotes a time derivative with respect to time t, and k= |k|.\nThe equation above has two independent solutions\n\u03b4\u03c1(k,t) \u221dexp (\u00b1i\u03c9(k)t) , (15)\nwhere\n\u03c9(k) =\n\u221a\nk2c2\ns \u22124\u03c0G\u03c10. (16)\nThe behavior of these isentropic perturbations depends crucially on the sign of the expression\nunder the square root. We will de\ufb01ne the Jeans length as\n\u03bbJ = 2\u03c0\nkJ\n= cs\n( \u03c0\nG\u03c10\n)1/2\n, (17)\nsuch that \u03c9(kJ) = 0, we conclude that if \u03bb < \u03bbJ (k > kJ), \u03c9(k) is real and the solutions\ndescribe acoustic oscillations (sound waves)\n\u03b4\u03c1(k,t) \u221dsin (\u03c9t+ k \u00b7r + \u03b1) , (18)\npropagating with phase velocity\ncphase = \u03c9(k)\nk = cs\n\u221a\n1 \u2212k2\nJ\nk2 . (19)\nIn the limit k \u226b kJ, that is on very small scales ( \u03bb \u226a \u03bbJ) where gravity is negligible\ncompared to the pressure, we have cphase \u2192cs, as should be the case.\nOn large scales gravity dominates and if k <kJ (\u03bb>\u03bb J), we have \u03c9(k) is imaginary and\n\u03b4\u03c1(k,t) \u221dexp (\u00b1|\u03c9|t) . (20)\nOne of these solutions describes the exponentially fast growth of inhomogeneities, while the\nother corresponds to a decaying mode. When k\u21920, |\u03c9|t\u2192t/tgr where\ntgr \u2261 1\u221a4\u03c0G\u03c10\n. (21)\nWe interpret tgr as the characteristic collapse time for a region with initial density \u03c10.\nInspecting the de\ufb01nition of the Jeans length, we see that it is \u03bbJ \u223ccstgr, or the distance\nwhich sound waves can travel in a gravitational free-fall time. It thus characterizes the\nmaximum distance over which sound waves can communicate, allowing pressure forces to\ncounteract changes in the density due to gravitational instability. For \ufb02uctuations larger\nthan this maximum distance \u03bb > \u03bbJ (k < kJ), pressure cannot react quickly enough and\nthe mode is unstable to gravitational collapse. For shorter wavelengths, \u03bb < \u03bbJ (k > kJ)\npressure can react, and a pressure gradient is created which then counteracts collapse and\ninstead gives rise to acoustic oscillations. We thus see that for long wavelength modes\n\u03bb >\u03bbJ, gravitational instability is extremely e\ufb03cient in a static universe. Small amplitude\n4\nperturbations will be exponentially ampli\ufb01ed on the gravitational free-fall timescale tgr.\n2 Gravitational Instability in an Expanding Universe\n2.1 Background Homogenous Universe\nWe will now work through the math for perturbation theory in an expanding universe. In an\nexpanding homogenous and isotropic universe, the background energy density is a function\nof time, and the background velocities obey the Hubble law. At the beginning of the course\nwe derived the Friedmann equations from Newtonian mechanics by considering a uniform\nexpanding ball of \ufb02uid. Here we repeat this analysis but now from the perspective of the\n\ufb02uid equations. Without perturbations we have\n\u03c1= \u03c10(t) and v = v0 = H(t)r. (22)\nPlugging these into the continuity equation\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202t + \u2207\u00b7(\u03c1v) = 0\n\u21d2\u2202\u03c10(t)\n\u2202t + \u2207\u00b7[\u03c10(t)H(t)r] = \u2202\u03c10(t)\n\u2202t + 3\u03c10(t)H(t) = 0. (23)\nThis just states that the total mass-energy of non-relativistic matter is conserved. This is\nequivalent to the energy equation we derived for an FRW universe \u02d9 \u03c1+ 3H(\u03c1+ P/c2) = 0,\nfor the case of P \u226a\u03c1c2, i.e. in the Newtonian limit of a non-relativistic \ufb02uid.\nNow consider the Poisson equation \u22072\u03a6 = 4 \u03c0G\u03c1. Taking \u03a6 = 0 at r = 0, the Poisson\nequation integrates as\n\u2202\n\u2202r\n(\nr2 \u2202\u03a6\n\u2202r\n)\n= (4\u03c0G\u03c10) r2 (24)\n\u21d2\u2202\u03a6\n\u2202r = 1\n3 (4\u03c0G\u03c10) r (25)\n\u21d2\u03a6 = 1\n6 (4\u03c0G\u03c10) r2 (26)\nThe Euler equation becomes\n\u2202v\n\u2202t + (v \u00b7\u2207)v = \u2212\u2207P\n\u03c1 \u2212\u2207\u03a6 (27)\n\u21d2 \u2202\n\u2202t(H(t)r) + (H(t)r \u00b7\u2207) [H(t)r] = \u2212\u2207P\n\u03c10\n\u2212\u2207\u03a6 (28)\n\u02d9Hr + H2 (r \u00b7\u2207)r\ued19 \ued18\ued17 \ued1a\nr\n= \u22124\u03c0G\u03c10\n3 r (29)\n\u21d2 \u02d9H+ H2 = \u22124\u03c0G\u03c10\n3 , (30)\n5\nwhere we used eqn. (26) above for \u2207\u03c6 and assumed \u2207P = 0, since P = P(\u03c1) and we are\nassuming a homogenous universe with \u03c1 = \u03c10(t) so there there are no pressure gradients.\nBut note that\n\u02d9H = d\ndt\n(\u02d9a\na\n)\n= \u00a8a\na \u2212H2 \u21d2 \u02d9H+ H2 = \u00a8a\na, (31)\nbut recalling the acceleration equation\n\u00a8a\na = \u22124\u03c0G\n3 (\u03c1+ 3P\nc2 ) (32)\nwe see that the acceleration equation implies\n\u02d9H+ H2 = \u22124\u03c0G\n3 (\u03c1+ 3P\nc2 ). (33)\nThus comparing the equation above, derived from the acceleration equation, to the result\nof applying the Euler equation to the background model in eqn. (30), we see that they are\nequivalent if \u03c1+ 3P/c2 \u2248\u03c1, or P \u226a\u03c1c2, which is again true in the Newtonian limit of\na non-relativistic \ufb02uid. Or equivalently, GR states that the source of gravity is not \u03c1 but\nrather \u03c1+ 3P/c2.\n2.2 Perturbed Expanding Universe\nAgain considering isentropic perturbations (i.e. ignoring entropy perturbations so that \u03b4S =\n0) we now proceed analgously to the static universe case and perturb about the expanding\nuniverse\n\u03c1(r,t) = \u03c10(t) + \u03b4\u03c1(r,t)\nP(r,t) = P0 + \u03b4P(r,t) = P0 + c2\ns\u03b4\u03c1(r,t)\nv(r,t) = H(t)r + \u03b4v(r,t) (34)\n\u03a6(r,t) = \u03a60(r,t) + \u03b4\u03a6(r,t). (35)\nPlugging these expressions into the \ufb02uid eqns. (1)-(3), using the results for the background\nterms from the previous subsection, and keeping only terms up to linear order we \ufb01nally\nobtain\n\u2202\u03b4\u03c1\n\u2202t +\u03c10\u2207\u00b7\u03b4v + \u2207\u00b7(\u03b4\u03c1v0) = 0 (Continuity) (36)\n\u2202\u03b4v\n\u2202t + (v0 \u00b7\u2207)\u03b4v+(\u03b4v \u00b7\u2207)v0 + c2\ns\n\u03c10\n\u2207\u03b4\u03c1+ \u2207\u03b4\u03a6 = 0 (Euler) (37)\n\u22072\u03b4\u03a6 = 4\u03c0G\u03b4\u03c1 (Poisson) (38)\nNote that the Hubble velocity v0 depends explicitly on r and therefore taking the Fourier\ntransform with respect to these Eulerian coordinates r does not reduce these equations to a\nsimple decoupled set of ordinary di\ufb00erential equations for the Fourier modes \u03b4\u03c1(k) as before.\nFor this reason it is more convenient to work with so-called Lagrangian coordinates x which\n6\nare comoving with the Hubble \ufb02ow , which are related to the Eulerian coordinates via\nr = a(t)x, (39)\nwhere a(t) is the scale factor. However, with this new choice of coordinates we have to work\nout how the derivatives in the equations above transform. For example, the partial derivative\nwith respect to time taken at constant r is di\ufb00erent from the partial derivative with respect\nto time taken at constant x. Consider a general function f(r,t), which we want to express\nat f(r = a(t)x,t). We can write\ndf=\n(\u2202f\n\u2202t\n)\nx\ndt+\n(\u2202f\n\u2202x\n)\nt\n\u00b7dx =\n(\u2202f\n\u2202t\n)\nr\ndt+\n(\u2202f\n\u2202r\n)\nt\n\u00b7dr. (40)\nBut note that\ndr = x\u02d9adt+ a(t)dx = v0dt+ a(t)dx, (41)\nwhere the last equality used\nv0 = dr\ndt = \u02d9ax = H(t)r. (42)\nThus our equation for dfabove becomes\ndf=\n(\u2202f\n\u2202t\n)\nx\ndt+\n(\u2202f\n\u2202x\n)\nt\n\u00b7dx =\n(\u2202f\n\u2202t\n)\nr\ndt+\n(\u2202f\n\u2202r\n)\nt\n\u00b7[v0dt+ a(t)dx]\n=\n[(\u2202f\n\u2202t\n)\nr\n+ v0 \u00b7\n(\u2202f\n\u2202r\n)\nt\n]\ndt+ a(t)\n(\u2202f\n\u2202r\n)\nt\n\u00b7dx. (43)\nThus gathering terms we conclude\n(\u2202\n\u2202t\n)\nr\n=\n(\u2202\n\u2202t\n)\nx\n\u2212(v0 \u00b7\u2207r) (44)\n\u2207r = 1\na\u2207x. (45)\nReplacing the derviatives in eqns. (38) and introducing the fractional amplitude of the density\npertubrations \u03b4= \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c10, we \ufb01nally obtain\n\u2202\u03b4\n\u2202t + 1\na\u2207\u00b7\u03b4v = 0 (Continuity) (46)\n\u2202\u03b4v\n\u2202t + H\u03b4v + c2\ns\na\u2207\u03b4+ 1\na\u2207\u03b4\u03a6 = 0 (Euler) (47)\n\u22072\u03b4\u03a6 = 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c10\u03b4 (Poisson), (48)\nwhere now \u2207\u2261\u2207 x, \u22072 \u2261\u22072\nx are all derivatives with respect to the Lagrangian coordinates\nx, and the time partial derivatives are taken at constant x. In deriving the equations above,\nwe used that \u2207r \u00b7v0 = 3H and (\u03b4v\u00b7\u2207r)v0 = H\u03b4v. Finally, we can take the divergence of the\nEuler eqn. (47) and using the continuity and Poisson equations to express \u2207\u00b7\u03b4v and \u22072\u03c6\nin terms of \u03b4, we derive the closed form equation which describes gravitational instability in\n7\nan expanding universe\n\u00a8\u03b4+ 2H\u02d9\u03b4\u2212c2\ns\na2 \u22072\u03b4\u22124\u03c0G\u03c10\u03b4= 0. (49)\nLet\u2019s brie\ufb02y discuss the terms that appear in this equation:\n\u00a8\u03b4+ 2 H\u02d9\u03b4\ued19\ued18\ued17\ued1a\nHubble Drag\n= 4\u03c0G\u03c10\u03b4\ued19 \ued18\ued17 \ued1a\ngravity\n+ c2\ns\na2 \u22072\u03b4\n\ued19 \ued18\ued17 \ued1a\npressure\n. (50)\nThe right-hand side has two source terms which are familiar from our study of Jeans in-\nstability in a static universe, namely a gravitational term which promotes collapse, and a\npressure term which opposes collapse. There is however now a new Hubble Drag term\nwhich encodes the fact that the expansion of the universe acts like a friction term opposing\nthe acceleration of gravitational instability.\n2.3 Solution for an Einstein De-Sitter Universe\nWe observe that now in Lagrangian or comoving coordinates, the terms in eqn. (49) have\ncoe\ufb03cients which are independent of the spatial coordinates x, allowing us to perform a\nFourier decomposition of the overdensity \ufb01eld \u03b4(x)\n\u03b4(x,t) =\n\u222b d3k\n(2\u03c0)3 \u03b4(k,t)eik\u00b7x. (51)\nPlugging this expression into eqn. (49) and noting\u2207\u2192 ik, we obtain an ordinary di\ufb00erential\nequation for each independent Fourier mode\n\u00a8\u03b4k + 2H\u02d9\u03b4k = \u03b4k\n(\n4\u03c0G\u03c10 \u2212c2\nsk2\na2\n)\n, (52)\nwhere we have abbreviated \u03b4(k,t) with \u03b4k. Note that since we are working in comoving\ncoordinates x, the wavenumbers k in eqn. (51) and the equation above are all comoving\nwavenumbers which correspond to \ufb02uctuations with wavelength \u03bb = 2\u03c0/k which is also a\ncomoving wavelength.\nIf we consider the limit H = 0 and a(t) = 1, i.e. a static universe, we recover eqn. (14) that\nwe derived in \u00a71 for a static homogenous universe\n\u00a8\u03b4k + \u03b4k\n(\nc2\nsk2 \u22124\u03c0G\u03c10\n)\n. (53)\nThe di\ufb00erence now is that we are dealing with comoving wavenumbers k, and that there\nis an extra Hubble drag term 2 H\u02d9\u03b4k that slows down the growth relative to the static case\nwhich we will discuss momentarily. Based on what we learned in the static universe, we\nknow that the behavior of a perturbation depends crucially on its spatial size, where the\ncritical lengthscale which separates acoustic oscillations from gravitational instability is the\n8\nJeans scale\n\u03bbJ = 2\u03c0a\nkJ\n= cs\n( \u03c0\nG\u03c10\n)1/2\n. (54)\nNote that the Jeans scale here is a proper wavelength, which explains the presence of the\nscale factor in eqn. (54) above, which converts the comoving wavelength \u03bbcom\nJ = 2\u03c0/kJ to a\nproper wavelength via \u03bbJ = a\u03bbcom\nJ .\nConsider a \ufb02at, matter dominated universe, also known as an Einstein-de Sitter Universe.\nThe Friedmann equation states\nH2(t) = 8\u03c0G\n3 \u03c10(t), (55)\nand since \u03c1\u221da\u22123 we saw previously that\na\u221dt2/3 \u21d2 H = 2\n3t \u21d2 \u03c10(t) = 1\n6\u03c0Gt2 , (56)\nwhich implies\n\u03bbJ =\n\u221a\n6\u03c0cst\u223ccst, (57)\nthat is, the Jeans length is comparable to the \u201csound horizon\u201d, which is the proper distance\nthat a sound wave can travel over the age of the Universe. Thus analgous to the static case\nwe \ufb01nd that the Jeans scale can be thought of as the \u201csound communication\u201d time or the\ndistance that a sound wave can travel in a gravitaional free-fall time which is also equal to\nthe expansion time H\u22121 in an expanding universe.\nPerturbations on scales much smaller than the Jeans scale ( \u03bb\u226a\u03bbJ) are oscillatory acoustic\nwaves, whereas on scales much larger than the Jeans scale ( \u03bb\u226b\u03bbJ), gravity will dominate\nleading to collapse. But now owing to the expansion of the Universe, \u03bbJ changes with time so\na given perturbation may switch between periods of growth and stasis (acoustic oscillations).\nWe will see that these e\ufb00ects govern the perturbation spectrum that has propagated into\nthe present universe from early times. We will return to acoustic oscillations shortly, for the\nmoment let us focus on scales \u03bb\u226b\u03bbJ or k\u226akJ such that we can igore the c2\nsk2/a2 relative\nto the gravitational driving term 4 \u03c0G\u03c10 in eqn. (52). For a \ufb02at matter dominated universe,\nusing the expressions in eqn. (56) for H(t) and \u03c10(t) eqn. (52) simpli\ufb01es to\n\u00a8\u03b4+ 2H\u02d9\u03b4= \u03b4\n(\n4\u03c0G\u03c10 \u2212c2\nsk2\na2\n)\n\u22484\u03c0G\u03c10\u03b4 (58)\n\u00a8\u03b4+ 4\n3t\n\u02d9\u03b4\u2212 2\n3t2 \u03b4= 0,\nwhere for simplicity we write \u03b4 to mean \u03b4k. If we guess that the solutions have a power law\nform\n\u03b4= Dtn, (59)\n9\nplugging this guess into the equation above yields\nn(n\u22121)Dtn\u22122 + 4\n3tnDtn\u22121 \u2212 2\n3t2 Dtn = 0 \u21d2 n(n\u22121) + 4\n3n\u22122\n3 = 0. (60)\nThe two possible solutions to the quadratic equation above are n= \u22121 and n= 2/3. Thus\nthe general solution for the time evolution of large-scale \u03bb\u226a\u03bbJ density perturbtations in a\n\ufb02at matter-dominated universe is\n\u03b4= D1t2/3 + D2t\u22121, (61)\nwwhere the values of D1 and D2 are determined by the initial conditions for \u03b4(t). The\ndecaying mode \u221dt\u22121 eventually becomes negligilbly small compared to the growing mode\n\u221dt2/3. Thus we see that once the growing mode dominates, the density of perturbations\ngrows at the rate\n\u03b4\u221dt2/3 \u221da(t) \u221d 1\n1 + z, (62)\nprovided the linear approximation \u03b4 \u226a1 holds. In the important case of a \ufb02at, matter-\ndominated universe, which is a good description of the universe at early times before \u039b\ntakes over, the growing mode is proportional to the scale factor. Hence, we see that in an\nexpanding universe, gravitational instability is much less e\ufb03cient. Whereas in the static\nuniverse \ufb02uctuations grow exponentially on the gravitational free-fall timescale, we see here\nthat instead the perturbation amplitude increases only as a power of time.\n2.4 Comparison to the CMB Anisotropy Level\nCMB anisotropy measurements probe temperature \ufb02uctuations which result from \ufb02uctua-\ntions in the radiation energy density \u03c1r \u221dT4, thus\n\u03b4\u03c1r\n\u03c1r\n= 4\u03b4T\nT . (63)\nPlanck measured the rms temperature \ufb02uctuation to be\n\u27e8(\u03b4T\nT\n)2\u27e91/2\n\u223c10\u22125 \u21d2 \u03b4\u03c1r\n\u03c1r\n\u223c10\u22125 \u21d2\u03b4b \u223c10\u22125 (64)\nwhere in the last equality we have assumed that \ufb02uctuations in the baryons must be compa-\nrable to the radiation, since the baryons are tightly coupled to the radiation by Thompson\nscattering prior to decoupling. We just learned that in a matter dominated universe, which\nis a good description of the universe prior to very recently (i.e. prior to zm\u039b \u22430.3), that\n\ufb02uctuations larger than the Jeans scale \u03bbJ grow proportional to the scale factor, thus we\nexpect\n\u03b4b(t0) \u223c a(t0)\na(tdec)\u03b4b(tdec) = (1 + zdec)\u03b4b(tdec) \u223c1100 \u00d710\u22125 \u223c10\u22122. (65)\n10\nBut we observe highly nonlinear structures in the universe today, and speci\ufb01cally we know\nthat even on relatively large comoving scales of 8 h\u22121 Mpc, approaching the smallest scales\nprobed by the CMB\n\u03c3(R= 8 h\u22121 Mpc) \u22431, (66)\nwhich is a factor of one hundred larger than our estimate above. Where did we go wrong?\nWell there are a couple of important complications that we have ignored:\n1. Nature of the perturbed component. The universe is made up of collisionless\ndark matter (cold, warm, hot?), baryons, and radiation. Our estimate above for the\n\ufb02uctuations from the CMB was based on using the CMB as a proxy for the baryonic\ncomponent. The \ufb02uctuations in the underlying dark matter were much larger than\n10\u22125 at decoupling explaining how we get large \u03c3(R = 8 h\u22121 Mpc) \u22431 today. This is\nactually one of the strongest pieces of evidence for dark matter.\n2. Species which dominates the energy density The expansion of the universe pow-\ners the Hubble drag term in eqn. 50, which opposes gravitational instability. We saw\nthat in the the matter dominated case expansion reduces the perturbation growth rate\nfrom exponential (static universe) to power law (expanding universe). We thus expect\nthat if other energy components (radiation, dark energy) dominate the expansion rate\nrelative to the component experiencing gravitational collapse (matter), that the growth\nof perturbations will slow down.\n3 Coupled Perturbations\nIf the energy density is comprised of a sum of contributions from di\ufb00erent components\n\u03c1=\n\u2211\ni\n\u03c1i, (67)\nwhere e.g. i=baryons, dark matter, photons, neturinos, etc., then the equation describing\nthe evolution of the perturbation \u03b4i in the non-relativistic component i is\n\u00a8\u03b4i + 2H\u02d9\u03b4i = \u2212c2\nsik2\na2 \u03b4i + 4\u03c0G\n[\u2211\nj\n\u03c1j\u03b4j\n\ued19 \ued18\ued17 \ued1a\nnon-relativistic\n+\n\u2211\nk\n2\u03c1k\u03b4k\n\ued19 \ued18\ued17 \ued1a\nrelativistic\n]\n. (68)\nWhereas the relativistic component obeys a slightly di\ufb00erent equation\n\u00a8\u03b4i + 2H\u02d9\u03b4i = \u2212c2k2\n3a2 \u03b4i + 4\u03c0G\n[\u2211\nj\n4\n3\u03c1j\u03b4j\n\ued19 \ued18\ued17 \ued1a\nnon-relativistic\n+\n\u2211\nk\n8\n3\u03c1k\u03b4k\n\ued19 \ued18\ued17 \ued1a\nrelativistic\n]\n. (69)\nThese modi\ufb01cations can be derived using special relativistic \ufb02uid mechanics and Newtownian\ngravity. The sound speed for a relativistic \ufb02uid is cs = c/\n\u221a\n3 follows from the fact that\n11\nP = \u03c1c2/3, which explains the pressure term for the relativistic component. The factors of\n2, 4/3, and 8/3 etc., come from the fact that pressure gravitates, and for a relativistic \ufb02uid\nthe pressure P is comparable to the energy density \u03c1.\n3.1 Matter and Radiation During Radiation Domination\nLet us now consider a multi-component system of cold dark matter, baryons, and radiation\nduring the era when the universe was radiation dominated. Radiation-matter equality occurs\nprior to decoupling, and the baryons and the photons will be tightly coupled together in a\nphoton-baryon \ufb02uid with a sound speed that is very close to the speed of light, whereas the\ndark matter is an independent collisionless matter component which only interacts with the\nphoton-baryon \ufb02uid gravitationally. The main point to note is that the \ufb02uctuations in this\nphoton-baryon \ufb02uid should be very small inside of the horizon, in other words, according to\neqn. (69) below \u03bbJ \u223ccH\u22121. Sub-Jeans radiation \ufb02uctuations therefore oscillate as sound\nwaves and their time-averaged density contrast vanishes. To describe these \ufb02uctuations\non the horizon scale properly GR is actually required. As such, typically when using the\nNewtonian equations above, one restricts attention to scales well within the horizon \u03bb \u226a\ncH\u22121. This means we can can assume the relativistic components have zero \ufb02uctuations\n\u03b4i \u22430. In this limit the equation describing the CDM \ufb02uctuations \u03b4c becomes\n\u00a8\u03b4c + 2H\u02d9\u03b4c = 4\u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c, (70)\nwhere the c2\nsk2/a2 term now vanishes because CDM is a collisionless matter component which\ndoes not experience pressure forces (i.e. cs = 0). This equation is identical to eqn. (58) except\nthat now we are not matter dominated. When the universe is radiation dominated\nH = 1\n2t; H2 = 8\u03c0G\n3 (\u03c1r + \u03c1c) \u22488\u03c0G\u03c1r\n3 , (71)\nwhere in the last equality we assumed \u03c1r \u226b\u03c1c since we are radiation dominated. Note also\nthat the \ufb01rst two terms in eqn. (70)\n\u00a8\u03b4c \u223c2H\u02d9\u03b4c \u223cH2\u03b4c (72)\nsince the only timescale in the problem is the Hubble time (if pressure forces were relevant\nthe other relevant timescale would be the sound crossing time \u03bb/cs, but we have assumed\ncollisionless dark matter). But since\n4\u03c0G\u03c1c \u226a4\u03c0G\u03c1r \u223cH2, (73)\nwe can neglect the term on the right-hand side of eqn. (70) relative to the other two terms.\nIn other words\n\u00a8\u03b4c + 1\nt\n\u02d9\u03b4c \u22480., (74)\nThe solution to this equation is\n\u03b4c(t) = \u03b4c(ti)\n[\n1 + Aln\n(t\nti\n)]\n, (75)\n12\nthus only a solution with an initial \u201cvelocity\u201d, \u02d9\u03b4(ti) \u0338= 0, can actually grow (so that A\u0338= 0),\nand only logarithmically at that. This suppression of the growth of \ufb02uctuations on scales\ninside the photon-baryon \ufb02uid sound horizon during radiation domination is known as the\nMeszaros e\ufb00ect. It says that, at early times, the dominant energy of radiation drives the\nuniverse to expand so fast that the collisionless matter, whose gravity is sub-dominant, has\nno time to respond, and \u03b4 grows at most only logarithmically. At late times, the radiation\neventually becomes negligible, and the growth of perturbations increases smoothly to the\nEinstein-de Sitter \u03b4\u221da(t) behavior that we derived earlier.\n3.2 Late-Time Suppression of Structure Formation by \u039b\nAnalogous to the Meszaros e\ufb00ect is a similar suppression of perurbation growth at late times\nwhen the Universe becomes cosmological constant dominated. Indeed, this is more relevant\nto the future since we showed that the epoch of matter-\u039b equality is zm\u039b \u22430.3. In this limit\nthe equation governing CDM perturbations is\n\u00a8\u03b4c + 2H\u039b \u02d9\u03b4c \u22480, (76)\nwhere the Hubble parameter has the constant value H = H\u039b and we have assumed that we\nare dark energy dominated\n4\u03c0G\u03c1c \u226a4\u03c0G\u03c1\u039b \u223cH2\n\u039b. (77)\nThis equation has solutions of the form\n\u03b4c(t) = C1 + C2e\u22122H\u039bt, (78)\nthus we see that \u039b suppresses the growth of structure. There is only a decaying mode, and\na constant mode, but not a growing mode. As such, the \ufb02uctuations in the matter density\nreach a constant fractional amplitude.\nWe have thus seen how linear perturbations grow when the universe is Einstein-De Sitter\nand \u039b dominated. In general, we write the growing mode solution as\n\u03b4c(t) \u221dD(a), (79)\nwhere D(a) is the linear growth function, which has to be solved for numerically.\n3.3 Baryons and DM Before and After Decoupling\nNow let\u2019s consider this same mix of photons, baryons, and CDM but after matter radiation\nequality when the Universe is matter dominated. But now let\u2019s consider the \ufb02uctuations in\nthe photon-baryon \ufb02uid. The equations governing these coupled perturbations are\n\u00a8\u03b4c + 2H\u02d9\u03b4c = 4 \u03c0G(\u03c1c\u03b4c + \u03c1b\u03b4b) \u22484\u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c (80)\n\u00a8\u03b4b + 2H\u02d9\u03b4b = \u2212c2\nsk2\na2 + 4\u03c0G(\u03c1c\u03b4c + \u03c1b\u03b4b) \u2248\u2212c2\nsk2\na2 + 4\u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c, (81)\n13\nwhere in the last equality we have assumed that the dark matter dominates the matter\ncontent. Since the dark matter dominates the gravity and the expansion rate, and we are\nEinstein-de Sitter and matter dominated, eqn. (80) for the dark matter yields the growing\nsolution \u03b4 \u221d a(t) which we studied before. Thus the 4 \u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c in the baryon evolution\nequation can be thought of as an external driving term. Given the pressure term in the\nevolution equation for the baryons and the fact that the Jeans scale \u03bbJ \u2243csH\u22121 \u223ccH\u22121 is\ncomparable to the horizon size, nearly all modes inside the horizon have k \u226bkJ (\u03bb\u226a\u03bbJ).\nThus the high-sound speed causes the baryons to evolve di\ufb00erently than the dark matter,\nnamely the baryons will experience slowly declining sound waves\n\u03b4b \u221d 1\n(acs)1/2 exp\n[\n\u00b1ik\n\u222b csdt\na(t)\n]\n. (82)\nThese are the acoustic oscillations that give rise to the peaks in the CMB and the baryon\nacoustic oscillation signature in the dark matter power spectrum (via the small-back reaction\nof the baryons on the dark matter, which we have above ignored). Since some of the these\nare large-scale horizon size modes, and since the baryons and photons are tightly coupled\ninto a single \ufb02uid, typically one resorts to GR to solve this problem correctly.\nNow let\u2019s examine what happens after decoupling. As you will show in the homework, the\nsound speed of the baryons drops precipitously, and now the Jeans scale of the baryons is\nextremely small, about comparable to the mass of a globular cluster. We can thus now\nconsider the coupled perturbations, but ignore the pressure term\n\u00a8\u03b4c + 2H\u02d9\u03b4c \u22484\u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c (83)\n\u00a8\u03b4b + 2H\u02d9\u03b4b \u22484\u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c. (84)\nWe know that the solution for the dark matter growth has the solution\n\u03b4c = (constant)a\u2261\u03b1a. (85)\nSubstituting this result into eqn. (84) for the baryon evolution, we can write it as\na3/2 d\nda\n( 1\na1/2\nd\u03b4b\nda\n)\n+ 2d\u03b4b\nda = 3\n2\u03b1, (86)\nwhere we have assumed an Einstein-de Sitter matter dominated universe with a\u221dt2/3. This\nequation has the growing solution\n\u03b4b = \u03b1(a\u2212a0) = \u03b4c(a)\n(\n1 \u2212C\na\n)\n, (87)\nwhere C is some constant. This solution thus shows that \u03b4b \u2192\u03b4c for a \u226bC, even if for\nexample \u03b4b \u22480 at some a= C = adec. In other words, baryonic perturbations quickly \u2018catch\nup\u2019 with dark matter preturbations after decoupling. This in turn allows us to understand\nhow the \ufb02uctuations in the baryons can be so small \u03b4b \u223c\u2206T/T \u223c10\u22125 at decoupling,\nas implied by the CMB anisotropy level, but nevertheless grow to form large non-linear\n14\nstructures today. Whereas baryons are coupled to the photons prior to decoupling and\nthus have a horizon size Jeans scale (gigantic Jeans mass), the dark matter only interacts\ngravitationally and \ufb02uctuations have been growing all along.\n4 Understanding the Power Spectrum\nIn\ufb02ation predicts a nearly scale invariant power spectrum which can be quanti\ufb01ed in terms\nof the rms \ufb02uctuations \u03c32 of the Newtonian graviational potential, in other words at some\ninitial time ti when the \ufb02uctuations were put in place\n\u22062\n\u03a6(k,ti) \u2261d\u03c32(\u03a6)\ndln k = k3\n2\u03c02 P\u03a6(k,ti) = constant \u21d2 P\u03a6(k,ti) \u221dk\u22123. (88)\nFrom the perturbed Poisson\u2019s equation \u22072\u03b4\u03a6 = 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c10\u03b4, so in Fourier space we get\nk2\u03b4\u03a6 = \u22124\u03c0Ga2\u03c10\u03b4 \u21d2 P\u03b4 \u221dk4P\u03a6(k) \u21d2 P\u03b4(k) \u221dk, (89)\nthus in\ufb02ation predicts P(k) \u221dkn with n\u22431. Comparing this to the matter power spectrum,\nwe see that on large scales, k \u226akpeak \u22430.06 Mpc\u22121, P(k) \u221dk as expected, but on small\nscales, k \u226bkpeak, P(k) \u221dk\u22123, seemingly violating the prediction from in\ufb02ation. How can\nwe understand the shape of the power spectrum?\n4.1 Super-Horizon Growth of Perturbations\nOur treatment thus far has been purely Newtonian which is an action-at-a-distance theory.\nAs such it cannot deal with the fact that in an expanding spacetime there exist particle\nhorizons that limit the distance between causally connected regions of the universe. In\ufb02ation\ncreates perturbations on all scales including super-horizon scales. Fluctuations that were\ngenerated during in\ufb02ation are constantly entering the horizon as the universe expands. This\nnotion of super-horizon \ufb02uctuations is necessary to understand the peak in the matter power\nspectrum, P(k), and why it deviates from the scale invariant prediction from in\ufb02ationP(k) \u221d\nk on small scales. Only GR can properly treat the evolution of \ufb02uctuations comparable or\ngreater than the horizon scale. This is beyond the scope of this course so we will instead\nproceed heuristically. First, let\u2019s review what we know about horizons.\n4.1.1 Horizons\nPreviously we showed that if the the energy density is dominated by a single energy compo-\nnent with equation of state w such that the pressure is\nP = w\u03c1c2, (90)\nthen the \ufb02uid equation implies that\n\u03c1\u221da\u22123(1+w), (91)\n15\nand the Friedmann equation (ignoring curvature) then reads\nH2 = 8\u03c0G\u03c1\n3c2 \u21d2(aH)\u22121 = H\u22121\n0 a(1+3w)/2, (92)\nsuch that the comoving particle horizon is\ndph(a) =\n\u222b t\nti\ncdt\na =\n\u222b a\nai\nda\na\u02d9a =\n\u222b a\nai\n(aH)\u22121dln a= 2cH\u22121\n0\n1 + 3w\n[\na(1+3w)/2 \u2212a(1+3w)/2\ni\n]\n. (93)\nPreviously we argued that in\ufb02ation causes the horizon to diverge solving the horizon problem.\nHere we are interested in understanding the evolution of density \ufb02uctuations that were put\nin place by in\ufb02ation, so ai is here some very small scale factor after in\ufb02ation. This implies\nthe ai term in the equation above is basically zero, and we have\ndph(a) = 2cH\u22121\n0\n1 + 3wa(1+3w)/2. (94)\nThe particle horizon is a comoving distance, but for the moment, let\u2019s consider the proper\nparticle horizon at this scale factor a\nrph(a) = adph(a) = 2cH\u22121\n0\n1 + 3wa3(1+w)/2 (95)\nNote however that for this same model it is easy to show that\n2H\u22121\n0\n3(1 + w)a3(1+w)/2 = t \u21d2 a\u221dt\n2\n3(1+w) , (96)\nand thus we obtain the simple result\nrph(t) = (1 + w)3ct\n1 + 3w . (97)\nFor a matter dominated universe ( w = 0), rph(t) = 3 ct, whereas for radiation domination\n(w= 1/3), rph(t) = 2ct. Thus the proper particle horizon is always of order rph(t) \u223cct.\nNow consider how the proper size\u03bbprop of a perturbation with comoving wavelength\u03bbevolves\nwith time. We know that \u03bbprop = a(t)\u03bb, and given the scaling for a(t) implied by eqn. (96)\nwe see that\nrph = 2ct; \u03bbprop = a(t)\u03bb\u221dt1/2\u03bb; radiation dominated\nrph = 3ct; \u03bbprop = a(t)\u03bb\u221dt2/3\u03bb; matter dominated . (98)\nThus the proper size of a comoving perturbation \u03bb has a shallower time evolution than the\nproper particle horizon rph. This faster evolution of the horizon size means that modes which\nare initially outside of the horizon will at some time enter the horizon as the universe expands\nbecause the horizon grows faster and catches up with the proper scale. This is illustrated in\n16\nFig. 1.\nFigure 1: A \ufb02uctuation which is superhorizon scale at matter-radiation equality grows always,\nwhile a \ufb02uctuation which enters the horizon during the radiation dominated era stops growing\nin amplitude until the matter dominated era begins. Figure from Norman arxiv e-print\n1005.1100.\n4.1.2 Sub-Horizon Growth Rates\nThe reason why this notion of horizon entry is so important is that modes evolve di\ufb00erently\noutside of the horizon than they do when they are inside the horizon. Let\u2019s \ufb01rst recap how\nsub-horizon density perturbations grow and also consider how the gravitational potential\nevolves. We will restrict attention to the cold dark matter, which means we can ignore the\ne\ufb00ect of free-streaming, which we will discuss next. From our perturbation theory analyses we\nlearned that sub-horizon modes grow as the scale factor during matter domination \u03b4\u221da(t),\nbut grow at most logarithmically \u03b4 \u221dln a(t) during radiation domination (the Mezsaros\ne\ufb00ect):\n\u03b4(k,t) = \u03b4(k,ti)\n{\nln [a(t)/ai] radiation dominated\na(t)/ai matter dominated (99)\n17\nNow consider the graviational potential perturbation \u03b4\u03a6(x,t), which we can write\n\u03b4\u03a6(x,t) =\n\u222b d3k\n(2\u03c0)3 \u03b4\u03a6(k,t)eik\u00b7x, (100)\nThe perturbed Poisson equation can be written in k-space as\n\u22072\u03b4\u03a6 = 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c10\u03b4 \u21d2 \u2212k2\u03b4\u03a6(k,t) = 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c10\u03b4(k,t) \u21d2 \u03b4\u03a6(k,t) \u221d\u03b4(k,t)\u03c10(a)a2.\n(101)\nAccordingly, the sub-horizon evolution of the potential perturbation obeys\n\u03b4\u03a6(k,t) = \u03b4\u03a6(k,ti)\n{\n(a/ai)\u22122 radiation dominated\nconstant matter dominated , (102)\nwhere we used the scalings in eqn. (99) for \u03b4(k,t) and ignored the logarthmic dependence\nduring radiation domination given that is multiplied by a steeper a\u22122 time evolution. Thus\nthe potential perturbations decay asa\u22122 during radiation domination because of the Mezsaros\ne\ufb00ect, but is \u201cfrozen in\u201d at a constant during matter domination.\n4.1.3 Super-Horizon Growth Rates\nCrudely speaking, a super-horizon perturbation \u03bbprop >rph doesn\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d it is a perturba-\ntion as it has no causal knowledge of the metric on scales larger than itself. It is essentially\nan island universe which evolves independently of the regions it is causally disconnected\nfrom. In GR perturbation theory, the gravitational potential of these \ufb02uctuations is the\nperturbation to the metric. The upshot is that these super-horizon metric perturbations do\nnot evolve, they are frozen in and thus we have the result that for these modes the potential\nperturbation is constant in time. Hence for modes with\nk <kH \u22612\u03c0\ndph\n\u21d2 \u03b4\u03a6(k,t) = \u03b4\u03a6(k), (103)\nis constant in time.\nFrom Poisson\u2019s equation in k-space (see eqn. (101))\n\u2212k2\u03b4\u03a6(k) = 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c10(t)\u03b4(k,t) \u21d2 \u03b4(k,t) \u221dconstant\n\u03c10a2 . (104)\nThus for the growth rate of super-horizon density \ufb02uctuations we have that\n\u03b4(k,t) = \u03b4(k,ti)\n{\n(a/ai)2 radiation dominated\na/ai matter dominated (105)\nWe now begin to better understand why we need to keep track of when modes enter the\nhorizon. As shown in Fig. 1, small-scale modes will enter the horizon at early times when the\nuniverse is radiation dominated, at which point their density will stop growing (actually it\n18\nTable 1: Growth Rates of Density Perturbations\nradiation dominated matter dominated\n\u03b4\u03a6 \u03b4 \u03b4 \u03a6 \u03b4\nsub-horizon a\u22122 ln a constant a\nsuper-horizon constant a2 constant a\ncan grow up to logarithmically depending on initial conditions, but just assume it is constant\nfor now), and its potential will decay as a\u22122, because of the Mezsaros e\ufb00ect. Larger scale\nmodes which cross the horizon later during matter domination never go through this phase\nof stunted growth rate or equivalently potential decay. The di\ufb00erent growth rates for sub-\nhorizon and super-horizon \ufb02uctuations in the potential, \u03b4\u03a6, and density \u03b4, for radiation and\nmatter dominated universes are summarized in Table 1.\n4.2 Understanding the Power Spectrum Shape\nWe have now put the pieces together necessary to understand how the linear theory power\nspectrum gets its shape. There are two important things to highlight before we proceed.\nMuch easier to work with potential \ufb02uctuations\u2206\u03a6 In terms of how the perturbations\nevolve in the di\ufb00erent regimes, i.e. sub-horizon vs. super-horizon and radiation vs. matter\ndominated, it is clearly much easier to work with the potential, since Table 1, indicates that\nthe potential \ufb02uctuation basically remains constant in time in all but one case, sub-horizon\n\ufb02uctuations in a radiation dominated universe, where we see that it decays as a\u22122 due to\nthe Mezsaros e\ufb00ect.\nHorizon at Matter Radiation Equality It is clear that the comoving particle horizon at\nmatter-radiation equality,deq \u2261dph(aeq), is an important physical scale. Because the particle\nhorizon is a monotically increasing function of a, modes with a comoving size \u03bb>d eq larger\nthan the horizon at matter radiation equality entered the horizon when the universe was\nmatter dominated, whereas smaller modes \u03bb < deq entered the horizon when the universe\nwas still radiation dominated (see Fig. 1). It is only the latter set of small-scale modes\nwhich will have their potentials decay due to the Mezsaros e\ufb00ect. The comoving horizon at\nmatter-radiation equality is\ndeq \u2261dph(aeq) = 2(\n\u221a\n2 \u22121)cH\u22121\n0 [\u2126m(1 + zeq)]\u22121/2 = 110 Mpc (106)\nwhere we used\n1 + zeq = 3500\n(\u2126m,0\n0.30\n)( h\n0.70\n)\n, (107)\nwhich we previously calculated. Since we are working with the power spectrum, it is more\nconvenient to work with wavenumbers and we introduce\nkeq \u22612\u03c0\ndeq\n= 0.06 Mpc\u22121. (108)\n19\nNow let\u2019s consider an initial potential perturbation \u03b4\u03a6(k,ti) at some time ti \u226ateq, where\nteq is the time of matter radiation equality, which we would like to evolve forward to some\nlater time after decoupling t > tdec, but for which the universe is still matter dominated.\nFor concreteness we will focus on a dark matter perturbation, which dominates the matter,\nand anyway as we saw in \u00a73.3, the baryons will start tracking the dark matter perturbation\nshortly after decoupling.\nConsider modes with k < keq (\u03bb > deq), which will have entered the horizon when the\nuniverse was matter dominated. For both the super-horizon and sub-horizon evolution of\nthese modes the potential perturbation remains constant and thus\n\u03b4\u03a6(k,t) = \u03b4\u03a6(k,ti) ( k <keq). (109)\nNow consider smaller scale modes with k >keq (\u03bb<d eq). These modes entered the horizon\nwith potential perturbation at the value \u03b4\u03a6(k,ti) which was constant in time, but upon hori-\nzon entry, because the universe is radiation dominated, they su\ufb00er a\u22122 attenuation because\nof the Mezsaros e\ufb00ect until the epoch of matter radiation equality:\n\u03b4\u03a6(k,t) = \u03b4\u03a6(k,ti)\n(aenter(k)\naeq\n)2\n(k >keq)., (110)\nwhere aenter(k) is the scale factor at which the mode k entered the horizon, and the factor\n(aenter/aeq)2 re\ufb02ects the attenuation which occurs between the time aenter(k) and aeq. At\nlater times a > aeq the universe is no longer radiation dominated, and so the potential will\nthen remain at a constant value until the time t (recall we assumed that at t we are matter\ndominated).\nNotice that the time tenter at which the mode k with wavelength \u03bbenters the horizon during\nradiation domination is \ufb01xed by the evolution of the particle horizon that we computed in\neqn. (98) above in \u00a74.1.1\naenter(k)\u03bb= aenter\n2\u03c0\nk = 2ctenter \u21d2aenterk\u22121 \u221dtenter. (111)\nBut we also have that during radiation domination a\u221dt1/2, so combining these two propor-\ntionalities we have\naenter(k)k\u22121 \u221dtenter \u221da2\nenter(k) \u21d2aenter \u221dk\u22121, (112)\nwhich states that high- k (small-scale modes) entered the horizon earlier in time, which can\nbe clearly visualized from Fig. 1. This implies we can write the ratio\n(aenter(k)\naeq\n)2\n=\n(keq\nk\n)2\n. (113)\n20\nThus we obtain\n\u03b4\u03a6(k,t) =\n{\n\u03b4\u03a6(k,ti) k <keq\n\u03b4\u03a6(k,ti)(keq/k)2 k >keq\n. (114)\nNow using\n\u27e8\u03b4\u03a6(k,t)\u03b4\u03a6(k\u2032,t)\u27e9= (2\u03c0)3\u03b4D(k \u2212k\u2032)P\u03a6(k,t), (115)\nwe have\nP\u03a6(k,t) =\n{\nP\u03a6(k,ti) k <keq\nP\u03a6(k,ti)(keq/k)4 k >keq\n. (116)\nAs we metioned before, in\ufb02ation predicts a scale invariant potential perturbation, which has\nequal variance on all scales\n\u22062\n\u03a6(k,ti) \u2261d\u03c32(\u03a6)\ndln k = k3\n2\u03c02 P\u03a6(k,ti) = constant \u21d2 P\u03a6(k,ti) \u221dk\u22123. (117)\nBut the perturbed Poisson\u2019s equation (eqn. (101)) gives\n\u2212k2\u03b4\u03a6(k,t) = 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c10\u03b4(k,t) \u21d2 \u03b4(k,t) \u221dk2\u03b4\u03a6(k,t), (118)\nwhich implies the density and potential power spectra are related via\nP\u03b4 \u221dk4P\u03a6(k) \u21d2P\u03b4(k,ti) = Ak, (119)\nwhere A is a constant. So we \ufb01nally obtain\nP\u03b4(k,t) =\n{\nAk k <k eq\nAk(keq/k)4 \u221dk\u22123 k >keq\n, (120)\nwhich explains the shape of the linear theory power spectrum for the overdensity \u03b4, and why\nthe break in the shape occurs around keq = 0.06 Mpc\u22121. In reality the attenuation during\nradiation domination is more like ln a/a2, and furthermore the transition from radiation to\nmatter domination is smooth, which smooths out the peak in the power spectrum.\n4.3 Transfer Function\nWhat we have gone through in the last section is a simple analytical version of what the\nso-called transfer function is supposed to achieve. Namely, our goal is to write the linear\ntheory power spectrum for overdensity \ufb02uctuations at some time t as\nP(k,t) = P(k,ti)T2(k)D2(t), (121)\nwhere P(k,ti) is the power spectrum at the time at which the perturbations were created\n(i.e. after in\ufb02ation), D(t) is the linear growth rate that we de\ufb01ned earlier, and T2(k) is the\ntransfer function.\nThe transfer function can be written in terms of a relationship between the mode amplitude\n21\nFigure 2: The variation of the density contrast in photons (red), baryons (green) and CDM\n(blue) with scale factor for k= 0.01 Mpc\u22121 (top) and k= 1.0 Mpc\u22121 (bottom). The density\ncontrasts are plotted in the conformal Newtonian gauge. Note the change in behavior for\nthe small-scale modes around aeq \u223c3 \u00d710\u22124, and decoupling at adec \u223c10\u22123. Figure from\nChallinor.\nat a creation scale factor ai (time ti), and the mode amplitude at some scale factor am (time\ntm). Typically am is taken to be a time when the universe is still matter dominated, but\nwhere am is after recombination. Broadly speaking, the reason for choosing am to be an\nepoch after recombination is simply that prior to recombination the universe is opaque and\n22\nstructure is not observable. Thus one has\nT(k) = \u03b4(k,tm)\n\u03b4(k,ti) , (122)\nNote the transfer function is independent of the exact value of scale factor am, provided\nam is chosen to be when the universe is still matter dominated since at this point there are\nno other physical e\ufb00ects which could change the power spectrum shape in a k-dependent\nfashion until the universe starts to become \u039b dominated.\nThe transfer function models all the procceses that in\ufb02uence the growth of perturbations\nfrom formation until after recombination. We have discussed some but not all of these. The\nmain complication that we have ignored is related to the validity of the \ufb02uid approximation,\nwhich we discuss in the next section. There are many publicly avaialble codes to compute\nT(k). The major innovation was CMBFAST by Seljak and Zaldarriaga, as they \ufb01gured\nout a trick to perform the required Boltzmann equation integrations much faster than was\npreviously possible. There are now other codes that supercede CMBFAST in accuracy and\nease of use like CMBEASY, CAMB, CLASS, and PyCosmo.\nIn Fig. 2 we show transfer functions from one of these codes for photons, baryons, and\nCDM for modes of two di\ufb00erent sizes, one with k < keq, whereas the other has k > keq.\nFor the small-scall modes (lower panel), which are Jeans-stable ( k > kJ or \u03bb < \u03bbJ) before\nrecombination, we see acoustic oscillations in the tightly coupled photon-baryon \ufb02uid begin\nafter horizon entry a \u223c10\u22125, and then we observe the baryons catching up to the dark\nmatter after recombination when the Jeans mass plummets. Note that density contrast\nmode amplitudes appear to not evolve when they are outside the horizon, which appears\nto run contrary to our discussion in this section, i.e. see Table 1. This results from gauge\nfreedom, i.e. our description of how super-horizon modes evolve in \u00a74.1.3 was necessarily\ngauge dependent. Typically papers on the evolution of T(k) compare results in di\ufb00erent\ngauges. See for example Ma & Bertschinger (1995).\n5 Hot, Cold, or Warm Dark Matter?\n5.1 Free Streaming\nThe \ufb02uid approximation that we have used in these notes is valid only when the mean-free\npath of particles is much smaller than the spatial scale of the perturbation being considered.\nOtherwise, one has to use the Boltzmann equation to solve for the evolution of distribution\nfunctions. Perturbations in a nearly collisionless component (e.g. neutrinos, warm or hot\ndark matter) are subject to so-called Landau damping, also known as collisionless phase\nmixing or free streaming . Cold dark matter can be treated as a pressureless \ufb02uid in\nthe limit that the particles are so massive that there is no free-streaming due to their\nrandom thermal velocities. But for hot or warm dark matter, which could have inherited\nsigni\ufb01cant random thermal motions when the particles decoupled from the thermal bath,\nfree-streaming could be signi\ufb01cant. In such cases, one must use the Boltzmann equation to\nsolve for the evolution of perturbations comparable to the free-streaming scale. A similar\n23\nsituation arises for photons after decoupling, when they are no longer tightly coupled to the\nbaryons via Thompson scattering. As decoupling is approached, the photon mean free path\nbecomes larger, and photons can di\ufb00use out of overdense regions into underdense regions,\nthereby damping inhomogeneities in the photon-baryon plasma, a phenomenon known as\nSilk damping. To properly study the evolution of perturbations in the radiation (critical\ne.g. for the CMB) and their back reaction on perturbations in matter, one must resort to\nsolving the Boltzmann equation.\nThe transfer function codes that we described in the last section solve the Boltzmann equa-\ntion for various components (dark matter, photons, neutrinos) for which the \ufb02uid approxi-\nmations are invalid. We won\u2019t go into solving the Boltzmann equation for collisionless \ufb02uids,\nsince that is quite complicated. However, su\ufb03ce it to say that something like the \ufb02uid\nequations comes out, where the \u201cpressure\u201d is instead contributed by the random motions of\nthe collisionless particles. The same type of linear perturbation theory analysis leads one to\nconclude that scales larger than a Jeans scale are unstable to gravitational collapse\n\u03bbJ \u2261v\u2217\n( \u03c0\nG\u03c1\n)1/2\n, (123)\nwhere the velocity v\u2217 replaces the sound speed cs that we had before where\nv\u22122\n\u2217 =\n\u222b\nv\u22122f(v)d3v\u222b\nf(v)d3v \u2261\u27e8v\u22122\u27e9, (124)\nwhere f(v) is the collisionless particle (i.e. dark matter) velocity distribution function. For\nexample for a Maxwellian velocity distribution function v\u2217= \u03c3.\nJust like before, small-scale modes k > kJ give rise to oscillatory solutions, but the crucial\ndi\ufb00erence is that these free-streaming motions rapidly dissipate \ufb02uctuations with \u03bb < \u03bbFS.\nWhereas in a \ufb02uid with pressure, you set up oscillations, which could eventually turn into a\ngrowing mode for example if the Jeans scale rapidly drops (i.e. baryons after recombination),\nin this collisionless case, the \ufb02uctuations are actually erased because particles in an overdense\nregion can propagate to an underdense region rapidly equalizing any density \ufb02uctuations.\nHere we will simply estimate what the free-streaming length scale is, which you also did\non the homework. Once a collisonless species decouples from the thermal bath, which we\ntypically imagine to be an extremely early time tf when the particle froze-out, it simply\ntravels along a geodesic in an expanding Universe. We will assume that the particles motion\nis along a ray with d\u03b8 = d\u03c6 = 0, so that the proper distance that this particle travels in\nan expanding universe is just a(t)dx= v(t)dt, where dx is a di\ufb00erential comoving distance.\nThus the comoving distance traveled by a free-streaming particle from some initial time tf\nto time t is the integral of these in\ufb01tesimal comoving distance intervals dx, or\n\u03bbFS(t) =\n\u222b t\ntf\nv(t)\na(t\u2032)dt\u2032. (125)\n24\nNote the similarity of this expression to the particle horizon\ndph(t) =\n\u222b t\ntf\nc\na(t\u2032)dt\u2032. (126)\nTypically the calculation for\u03bbFS(t) is broken up into several parts, i.e. we assume the particle\nis relativistic from the time it freezes out tf to some time tNR, when it goes non-relativistic,\ni.e. when mXc2 \u223ckBTNR when the the thermal bath had a temperature TNR. For example\nif we consider massive neutrinos with m\u03bdc2 = 30 eV, which used to be invoked as a hot dark\nmatter candidate, then they go non-relativistic at\n(1 + zNR) \u223c60,000, (127)\nwhereas we know that the neutrinos decoupled from the thermal bath approximately 1safter\nthe Big Bang when kBT \u223c1 MeV or at\n(1 + zf) \u223c4.3 \u00d7109. (128)\nAt matter radiation equality zeq \u223c3500 the temperature of the Universe is kBT \u223c1 eV, and\nthe relevant hot or warm dark matter candidates have mass-energies larger than this, such\nthat one typically assumes tNR <teq. If we break eqn. (126) into contributions from various\nepochs, we can write\n\u03bbFS(t) =\n\u222b tNR\ntf\nc\na(t\u2032)dt\u2032+\n\u222b teq\ntNR\nv(t)\na(t\u2032)dt\u2032+\n\u222b t\nteq\nv(t)\na(t\u2032)dt\u2032. (129)\nThe free streaming is dominated by the relativistic part when v(t) = c, because after the\nparticle becomes non-relativistic Hubble drag implies v\u221da\u22121 or\nv(t) = c\n(aNR\na\n)\n, (130)\nand the velocity redshifts away quickly. Typcically one evaluates \u03bbFS(teq), since structures\nstart growing once the universe is matter dominated. One \ufb01nds\n\u03bbFS(teq) \u22432ctNR\naNR\n[2 + ln (aeq/aNR)] . (131)\nPlugging in numbers for neutrinos using the fact that the temperature is slightly di\ufb00erent\nthan the photon temperature T\u03bd = (4/11)1/3T\u03b3 (this is needed to compute aNR) one \ufb01nds\n\u03bbFS \u224330\n( m\u03bd\n30 eV\n)\u22121\nMpc, (132)\n25\nwhich corresponds to a free-streaming mass-scale\nMFS \u22614\u03c0\u03c1m,0\n3\n(\u03bbFS\n2\n)3\n= 1.3 \u00d71015\n( m\u03bd\n30 eV\n)\u22122\nM\u2299, (133)\nwhere to calculate MFS we used \u2126\u03bdh2 = 0.32(m\u03bd/30 eV), which results from calculation you\ndid on the neutrino energy density in the homework.\nThe left panel of Fig. 3 compares the linear theory dimensionless power spectrum of hot\ndark matter to that of cold dark matter illustrating the strong cuto\ufb00 at k= 2\u03c0/30 Mpc\u22121 \u2243\n0.2 Mpc\u22121. While a host of observations of cosmic structure rules out such a strong cuto\ufb00,\nthe behavior of the power spectrum at much smaller scales is an active \ufb01eld of research. In\nparticular, a so-called warm dark matter (WDM) particle with mWDM \u22438 keV would have\na free-streaming scale \u2243100 kpc corresponding to a mass scale of \u2243108M\u2299, and is often\ninvoked as a remedy for small-scale problems with the cold dark matter model. Observations\nof dwarf galaxies and the Ly\u03b1forest can be used to constrain or rule out these WDM models.\n0.01 0.1 1 10 100 103\nk [Mpc\u22121 ]\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n\u2206 2 (k)\n1018 1016 1014 1012 1010 108 106 104\nM [M\u2299]\nUnknown small\nscale behavior\nBaryon\nAcoustic\nOscillations\nCDM\nWDM(8keV)ADM\nCosmic Cluster Galactic\nlinear (analytic)\nnon-linear (simulation)\nFigure 3: Left: Linear theory power spectrum for hot dark matter compared to cold dark\nmatter.

Figure from Kuhlen, Vogelsberger\net al. 2012.\n5.2 Hierarchical Structure Formation\nFrom the right panel of Fig. 3, we see that in the standard cold dark matter model, the\npower \u22062(k) \u221dk3P(k) rises rapidly with k for k <keq, where the P(k) \u221dk scaling implies\n\u22062(k) \u221dk4, but then subsequently begins to \ufb02atten for k \u2273 keq = 0.06 Mpc\u22121, re\ufb02ecting\nthe P(k) \u221dln kk\u22123 part of the power spectrum where \u2206 2(k) \u223cln k. This has profound\nimplications for how cosmic structure forms.\nA good proxy for the progression of structure formation on a given scale is the variance of\nthe excess mass, which we calculated previously to be\n\u03c32\nM(R) = \u27e8(\u03b4M(x)/M)2\nR\u27e9=\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u22062(k)W2(k)dln k. (134)\n26\nThis integral can be easily evaluated when W(k) is a Gaussian\nW(x) = 1\n(2\u03c0)3/2R3 exp\n(\n\u2212x2\n2R2\n)\n\u21d2 W(k) = exp\n(\n\u2212k2R2\n2\n)\n. (135)\nand P(k) = Akn is a power law,\n\u03c32\nM(R) = A\n2 \u22062(k= R\u22121)\u0393\n(n+ 3\n2\n)\n. (136)\nSince \u22062(k) \u221dkn+3 this implies\n\u03c32\nM(R) \u221dR\u2212(n+3) \u221dM\u2212(n+3)/3, (137)\nwhere in the last proportionality we used M \u221dR3. We know that in the matter dominated\nphase the amplitude of modes grows as \u03b4k \u221da(t) \u221dt2/3, hence using that \u03c32 \u221d\u03b42\nk \u221da2 we\nhave that\n\u03c32\nM(R,t) \u221dt4/3R\u2212(n+3). (138)\nWe can assume that perturbations at some scale R become nonlinear when \u03c3(R) \u22431. It\nfollows that the time, t(R), at which a scale R becomes nonlinear satis\ufb01es the relation\ntR \u221dR3(n+3)/4 \u221dM(n+3)/4. (139)\nFor n >\u22123, which is true for the entire power spectrum, we see that tR is an increasing\nfunction of R and M. This implies that on average, smaller scales (radii and masses) be-\ncome nonlinear at earlier times than larger scales. This is what is known as hierarchical\nstructure formation. It states that structure formation occurs from the bottom up, with\nthe smallest structures going non-linear \ufb01rst, which then merge to form larger non-linear\nstructures which collapse later. As each unit goes non-linear, it will in general be comprised\nof a number of smaller condensations which had gone non-linear and collapsed earlier. This\nbehavior is a direct result of the shape of the power spectrum of cold dark matter.\nHot dark matter models which have a small-scale cuto\ufb00 at very large mass scales M \u223c\n1015M\u2299, form structures in a very di\ufb00erent manner. Namely, the \ufb01rst structures to go\nnon-linear are large structures, where there is still power present. These large non-linear\nstructures then fragment to form smaller non-linear structures. Thus for hot dark matter\nmodels, structure forms from the top down. A numerical computation of \u03c3(R) is shown in\nFig. 4 for various cosmogynies. Fig. 5 illustrates the di\ufb00erences in how structure forms for\nhot, warm, and cold dark matter cosmological models, which all results from the shape of\nthe linear theory power spectrum.\n27\nFigure 4: The variance of the linear density \ufb01eld, \u03c3(R), as a function of the radius, R, of a\ntop-hat window function containing mass M in di\ufb00erent cosmogonic models.

Here \u0393 = \u2126 m0h is the \u201cshape\u201d parameter which\ndetermines the horizon at matter radiation equality.\n28\nFigure 5: Cosmological N-body simulation illustrating the non-linear evolution of hot\n(left), warm (center), and cold (right) dark matter illustrating how structure is erased on\nprogressively larger scale when one goes from cold to hot.\n29"

Since most of the observed structures in the\nuniverse \u2013 like galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc. \u2013 have a density constrast far in excess of\nunity, their formation can only be understood with a fully nonlinear theory. In the non-linear\nregime the evolution of the density \ufb01eld can no longer be described with a simple growth\nrate D(a). In general no analytic solutions exist. Because non-linearity implies mode-\ncoupling, we no longer have a Gaussian random \ufb01eld. We previously discussed that this\nmostly arises due to phase correlations, but the power spectrum will also deviate from linear\ntheory, and furthermore higher-order moments besides the two-point function are required\nto describe the evolution. An accurate treatment will of course require solving the equations\nof structure formation on a computer. But we can consider highly oversimpli\ufb01ed analytical\napproximations which allow us to build intuition about this non-linear evolution which will\nprove very useful in undertsanding and interpreting these numerical results.\n1 Spherical Collapse\n1.1 Top-Hat Perturbation for an\u2126 = 1 Universe\nFigure 1: Illustration of a top-hat perturbation for the spherical collapse model. Figure from\nVandenbosch.\nOne of the most important nonlinear calculations in cosmology is spherical collapse for which\nan analytic fully non-linear solution exists. We consider a collisionless \ufb02uid (i.e dark matter)\nin a \ufb02at matter dominated Einstein-De Sitter (\u2126 = 1 .0) universe. Thus we have\nH = 2\n3t; \u00af \u03c1= 1\n6\u03c0Gt2 ; D(a) = a\u221dt2/3. (1)\nImagine that we setup a so-called top-hat perturbation in an otherwise homogenous universe\n1\nFigure 2: Left: Evolution of a top-hat perturbation in an EdS universe. Depending on\nthe E, the \ufb01rst integral of motion, the \ufb02uctuation collapses ( E <0), continues to expand\n(E >0), or asymptotically reaches it maximum radius ( E = 0). Virialization occurs when\nthe \ufb02uctuation has collapsed to half its turnaround radius. Figure from Norman review.\nRight: Schematic illustration of spherical top-hat evolution. The perturbation starts evolving\nwith the Hubble \ufb02ow, follows linear theory at early times, and then detatches from the Hubble\n\ufb02ow at turnaround tta, and collapses upon itself at tcoll.\nat some initial time ti, such that\n\u03b4(r,ti) =\n{\n\u03b4i r <R\n0 r\u2265R, (2)\nwhere \u03b4i = (\u03c1i\u2212\u00af\u03c1i)/\u00af\u03c1i, and \u00af\u03c1i is the background density atti. Let ri denote the proper radius\nof some mass shell inside the top-hat at ti. We proceed analogously to our semi-classical\nderivation of the Friedmann equation. Namely we apply Newton\u2019s laws to a test-particle at\nradius r,\n\u00a8r= \u2212GM\nr2 , (3)\nwhere M(< r) is the mass interior to r, where we have invoked Birkho\ufb00\u2019s theorem, which\nstates that the gravitational acceleration at any radius in a spherically symmetric system\ndepends only on the mass within that radius. Note that the mass enclosed within the shell\ncan be written\nM(<r) = 4\n3\u03c0r3\ni \u00af\u03c1i[1 + \u03b4i] = 4\n3\u03c0r3(t)\u00af\u03c1(t)[1 + \u03b4(t)], (4)\nwhere the second equality is a result of mass conservation, in other words, M(< r) is inde-\npendent of time. It is important to note that while r is the proper radial coordinate, the\nquantity r(t) is also the time dependent variable that we are solving for \u2013 it is the time\nevolution of the spherical shell encircling the constant mass M(<r) which was once interior\nto ri. We can thus imagine that the overdensity consists of in\ufb01nitesimally thin mass shells,\nwhere each shell evolves independently because of spherical symmetry. This should hold until\n\u2018shell-crossing\u2019, which is to say when the shells pass through the origin forming a singularity.\n2\nFigure 3: Illustration of the evolution of a spherical overdensity embedded in a \ufb02at Einstein-\nde Sitter Universe. The dotted curve shows the linear theory prediction, whereas the dashed\ncurves show the prediction of the nonlinear spherical collapse model. Shell crossing and\nvirialization will prevent the collapse to a singularity radius= 0, and resulting in a collapsed\nstructure with a \ufb01nite overdensity and radius, illustrated by the solid lines. Figure from\nBaumann.\nIn practice, this only happens for the idealized case of perfect spherical symmetry.\nIntegrating the equation of motion (eqn.(3)) once, exactly as we did when deriving the\nFriedmann equation, yields\n1\n2\n(dr\ndt\n)2\n\u2212GM\nr = E, (5)\nwhere the energy E is the speci\ufb01c energy of a given mass shell. The three possibilities for\nE are illustrated schematically in Fig. 2. Clearly E <0 is going to correspond to a bound\nsystem which will eventually collapse, whereas E >0 will not collapse. The case E = 0 is\nworth noting, it yields the solution\nr(t) =\n(9GM\n2\n)\nt2/3 \u221da(t). (6)\nThus for this special case, the mass shell (and hence the entire top-hat perturbation) grows\nat the same rate as the universe. Thus the product r3(t)\u00af\u03c1(t) in eqn. (4) is a constant and\nwe have that \u03b4(t) = \u03b4i, which is to say that the perturbation does not grow.\nWe are most interested in the E <0 case that will collapse. The resulting cycloid solution\n3\ncan be written in parameteric form as\nr(\u03b8) = A(1 \u2212cos \u03b8) ; t(\u03b8) = B(\u03b8\u2212sin \u03b8) , (7)\nwhere \u03b8\u2208[0,2\u03c0], and\nA= GM\n2|E| B = GM\n(2|E|)3/2 \u21d2 A3 = GMB2. (8)\nThis solution is illustrated schematically in Figs. 2 and 3. It implies the following evolution\nfor our mass shell,\n\u03b8= 0: Shell expands from r = 0 at time t = 0, i.e. this is the Big Bang of the\nbackground model.\n\u03b8= \u03c0: The mass shell reaches its maximum radius rta at t(\u03b8 = \u03c0) = tta = \u03c0B. Here\nthe ta subscript stands for turnaround, since the mass shell turns around and begins\ncollapsing.\n\u03b8= 2\u03c0: The mass shell collapses back to r= 0 at time t(\u03b8= 2\u03c0) = tcoll = 2\u03c0B = 2tta.\nWe can gain further insights into the nonlinear evolution of a top-hat perturbation by in-\nvoking energy conservation. The speci\ufb01c energy of the mass shell we are considering is a\nconstant of the motion,\nE = v2(t)\n2 \u2212GM\nr = v2\ni\n2 \u2212GM\nri\n, (9)\nwhere v(t) = dr(t)/dt, and in the last equality we evaluated E at time ti. Consider the\nbehavior of the velocity at early times vi = v(ti). Imagine de\ufb01ning comoving coordinates for\nour mass shell which take out the expansion due to the Hubble \ufb02ow\nr(t) = a(t)x(t), (10)\nthe velocity can be written\nv= dr(t)\ndt = \u02d9ax(t) + a\u02d9x(t) = H(t)r+ a\u02d9x(t), (11)\nat early times when the perturbation is small \u03b4i \u226a1\nv(ti) \u2243Hiri, (12)\nthat is, we can negelect the peculiar velocity term a\u02d9x(ti) relative to the Hubble \ufb02ow. We\ncan thus write the initial speci\ufb01c energy of the mass shell as\nEi = Ki + Ui = 1\n2H2\ni r2\ni \u2212GM\nri\n, (13)\n4\nusing the Friedmann equation H2 = 8\u03c0G\u00af\u03c1/3 we can write eqn. (4) for M(<r),\nM(<r) = 4\n3\u03c0r3\ni \u00af\u03c1i[1 + \u03b4i] = H2\ni r3\ni\n2G (1 + \u03b4i), (14)\nwhich implies\nEi = \u2212Ki\u03b4i = \u2212H2\ni r2\ni\n2 \u03b4i. (15)\nThus collapse requires Ei < 0 which implies \u03b4i > 0. We can also evaluate the energy at\nturn-around, tta, when r(t = tta) = rta and the velocity v(t = tta) = 0 must be zero. Since\nKta = 0, we have\nEta = Uta = \u2212GM\nrta\n= \u2212H2\ni r3\ni\n2rta\n(1 + \u03b4i), (16)\nwhere in the last equality we used eqn. (14) to express M(<r) in terms of Hi. From energy\nconservation we must have Eta = Ei, allowing us to write\nrta\nri\n= 1 + \u03b4i\n\u03b4i\n\u2243\u03b4\u22121\ni , (17)\nwhere we used the fact that the initial perturbation \u03b4i \u226a1. Hence, the turn-around radius\ndepends only on the initial overdensity \u03b4i (not on the actual mass enclosed by the shell).\nNote also that smaller perturbations have larger radii at turn-around, which implies that\nthey turnaround/collapse later.\nNow let us focus on the evolution of the actual overdensity. The mean density\u03c1(<r) interior\nto some radius r within the top-hat perturbation is\n\u03c1(t) = 3M\n4\u03c0r3 = 3M\n4\u03c0A3 (1 \u2212cos \u03b8)\u22123 , (18)\nwhereas the mean density of the background is\n\u00af\u03c1(t) = 1\n6\u03c0Gt2 = 1\n6\u03c0GB2 (\u03b8\u2212sin \u03b8)\u22122 , (19)\nhence the actual overdensity of our spherical top-hat region, according to the fully non-linear\nspherical collapse model, is\n1 + \u03b4(t) = \u03c1\n\u00af\u03c1 = 9\n2\n(\u03b8\u2212sin \u03b8)2\n(1 \u2212cos \u03b8)3 , (20)\nwhere we have used that A3 = GMB2. Before we discuss this solution in further detail, we\nwill \ufb01rst compare it to linear theory.\n1.2 Comparison to Linear Theory\nOne of the main uses of the spherical collapse model is that it allows us to obtain a mapping\nbetween the extrapolated linear theory evolution of perturbations and their fully non-linear\n5\nevolution. This then provides a simple tool for determining when perturbations in the initial\nlinear \ufb02uctuations go non-linear and when they collapse. We will use this mapping when we\ndiscuss the Press-Schecter model for the abundance of dark matter halos, which allows one\nto compute halo abundances analytically using only the linear theory power spectrum.\nAccording to linear perturbation theory, in an Einstein-De Sitter universe perturbations grow\naccording to\n\u03b4lin \u221dD(a) \u221da\u221dt2/3 \u21d2 \u03b4lin = \u03b4i\n(t\nti\n)2/3\n. (21)\nIn order to compare our linear theory to the fully non-linear spherical collapse solution, we\nneed to determine how to normalize the linear theory solution, which amounts to matching\nthe initial conditions of our spherical collapse calculation. To do this, we Taylor expand the\nnon-linear solution for the overdensity in eqn. (20). Using\nsin \u03b8\u2243\u03b8\u2212\u03b83\n3! + \u03b85\n5! \u2212... (22)\ncos \u03b8\u22431 \u2212\u03b82\n2! + \u03b84\n4! \u2212..., (23)\nwhere we can ignore higher order terms, since the validity of linear theory requires \u03b4 \u226a1,\nwhich implies t\u226atta = \u03c0B and hence \u03b8\u226a1. Thus\n(\u03b8\u2212sin \u03b8)2 \u2243\n(\u03b83\n6 \u2212 \u03b85\n120\n)2\n\u2243\u03b86\n36\n[\n1 \u2212\u03b82\n10\n]\n(24)\n(1 \u2212cos \u03b8)3 \u2243\n(\u03b82\n2 \u2212\u03b84\n24\n)3\n\u2243\u03b86\n8\n[\n1 \u2212\u03b82\n4\n]\n. (25)\nCombining we \ufb01nd that in the \u03b8\u226a1 limit\n1 + \u03b4=\n9\u03b86\n36\n[\n1 \u2212\u03b82\n10\n]\n2\u03b86\n8\n[\n1 \u2212\u03b82\n4\n] \u2243\n[\n1 \u2212\u03b82\n10\n]\n\u00d7\n[\n1 + \u03b82\n4\n]\n\u22431 + 3\u03b82\n20 , (26)\nfrom which we conclude that\n\u03b4= 3\u03b82\n20 . (27)\nIf we now use that\nt= B(\u03b8\u2212sin \u03b8) \u2243B\u03b83\n6 , (28)\nwe see that in the \u03b8\u226a1 limit\n\u03b8\u2243\n(6t\nB\n)1/3\n. (29)\nSubstituting the above expression for \u03b8 into eqn. (27) for \u03b4 we \ufb01nally obtain that that for\n6\nt\u226atta = \u03c0B, which implies \u03b8\u226a1 and \u03b4\u226a1,\n\u03b4(t) = 3\n20\n(6t\nB\n)2/3\n(\u03b4\u226a1). (30)\nThus as expected, we see that in the small \u03b4 regime, the spherical collapse solution recovers\nthe \u03b4\u221dt2/3 \u221da behavior of linear theory. Noting that the linear theory solution follows\n\u03b4lin = \u03b4i\n(t\nti\n)2/3\n, (31)\nto match the small t (small \u03b8 and \u03b4) behavior of the linear and nonlinear solution, we can\nevaluate both at t= ti, which implies\nB = 3ti\n4 (5\u03b4i/3)3/2 , (32)\ncombining with A3 = GMB2 and the expression for M in eqn. (14), we deduce that\nA= 3ri\n10\u03b4i\n. (33)\nHence the non-linear solution is completely speci\ufb01ed in terms of quantities at ti. Note that\nsince B only depends on ti and \u03b4i, the time for turn around tta = \u03c0B and for collapse\ntcoll = 2\u03c0B, occur simultaneously for all mass shells. Formally, at tcoll all the mass collapses\nto a singularity, but we will return to what actually happens at collapse for a more realistic\nnot-perfectly spherically symmetric situation shortly.\nNext we want to study the linear evolution on the same \u2018clock\u2019 as the non-linear evolution.\nThe equations above apply to \u03b8 \u226a1, but we need to use t(\u03b8) in eqn. (7) for larger \u03b8. Thus\nwe combine the two equations\n\u03b4lin = \u03b4i\n(t\nti\n)2/3\n; t= B(\u03b8\u2212sin \u03b8) (34)\nto obtain\n\u03b4lin = 3\n5\n(3\n4\n)2/3\n(\u03b8\u2212sin \u03b8)2/3 . (35)\nWe have now expressed the linear theory solution in terms of the parameters of our fully\nnon-linear solution, allowing us to compare their predictions at di\ufb00erent times.\nThis mapping between linear and non-linear evolution is very powerful. Given the linear\ntheory evolution of a density \ufb02uctuation, we can then make statements about what the\nfully nonlinear density constrast should be assuming spherical collapse. Some relevant times\nare calculated in Table 1. When a region is at turnaround with \u03b8 = \u03c0 and t = tta and\nis detatching from the Hubble \ufb02ow, \u03b4(\u03b8 = \u03c0) = 4 .6, so the characteristic overdensity of\nregions turning around is \u03b4ta = 4.6! Furthermore, at this time, the linear theory contrast is\n7\n\u03b4lin,ta(\u03b8= \u03c0) = 1.06. Consider a region that had a linear \ufb02uctuation of\n\u03b4lin = 0.1 at z = 20. (36)\nOur calculation thus implies it was at turnaround roughly at\na(tta)\na(z = 20)\u03b4lin = \u03b4lin,ta \u21d2 (1 + zta) = (1 + 20) \u03b4lin\n\u03b4lin,ta\n\u21d2 (1 + zta) \u22432.0. (37)\nFurthermore, according to Table 1, we learn that att= 2\u03c0when the spherical collapse model\nimplies collapse to a singularity, the linear theory density contrast is \u03b4lin = 1.69. Thus if\nwe extrapolate linear theory to have an overdensity \u03b4lin >1.69, this corresponds to a region\nwhich has t>t coll in the spherical collapse model. For this reason we de\ufb01ne the threshold\n\u03b4c \u22611.69 (38)\nas the critical overdensity for collapse. We will see that \u03b4c plays a very important role\nin Press-Schecther theory. Although our derivation focused on a top-hat perturbation with\nvalue \u03b4i it can be shown that our treatment is also valid for any monotonically decreasing\n(with r) perturbation, with the understanding that we then replace \u03b4 with \u00af\u03b4. As for the\ncosmological model, our results were computed for an Einstein-De Sitter universe, but it\nturns out the critical density for collapse \u03b4c is also remarkably insensitive to cosmology.\nWhat are the turnaround and collapse redshifts of a perurbation at z = 100 which has\n\u03b4i = 0.1?\nTable 1: Spherical Collapse vs. Linear Theory\n\u03b8 t Spherical Collapse Linear Theory\n\u03b4(t) =9\n2\n(\u03b8\u2212sin \u03b8)2\n(1\u2212cos \u03b8)3 \u22121 3\n5\n(3\n4\n)2/3\n(\u03b8\u2212sin \u03b8)2/3\n\u03c0/2 tta/2 0.466 0.341\n2\u03c0/3 2tta/3 1.01 0.568\n\u03c0 tta 4.55 1.06\n2\u03c0 tcoll = 2tta \u221e 1.69\n8\n1.3 Virialization\nOur spherical collapse calculation described above relied on the fact that the mass M(<r )\nwhich was interior to our initial radius ri is a conserved quantity, which is to say that spher-\nical shells containing in\ufb01tesimally di\ufb00ering amounts of mass do not cross. In the idealized\nspherically symmetric calculation we performed, this shell crossing \ufb01nally happens at\u03b8= 2\u03c0,\nwhich is the instant when all the mass collapses to a point. However, long before this happens\nthe approximation that the matter is distributed in perfectly spherically symmetric shells,\nand that the random (i.e. non-radial) velocities of the particles are small, will break down.\nThe collisionless matter we are considering will reach what is known as virial equilibrium\nby a process known as violent relaxation. Violent relaxation occurs as follows. During\nthe collapse there will be large \ufb02uctuations in the gravitational potential, on a time-scale\nor order of the free-fall collapse time tdyn = (G\u03c1)\u22121/2. Since the potential is changing with\ntime, individual particles do not follow energy conserving orbits. The change in energy of a\nparticle over this collapse timescale will depend in a complex way on its initial position and\nvelocity, but the net e\ufb00ect will be to redistribute energy among the particles and widen the\nrange of energies available to the particles. Thus a rapidly time variable potential provides\na mechanism for particles to exchange energy and relax to an equilibrium distribution on a\ntimescale tdyn which is much shorter than the 2-body relaxation timescale trelax \u2243Ntdyn/\n(10 lnN), which is normally the timescale which governs the evolution of a self-gravitating\ndistribution of N particles. Since the dark matter particle mass is likely extremely small,\nthe 2-body relaxation time would be many orders of magnitude larger than the Hubble time\ntrelax \u226btH. Violent relaxation operates much faster, and allows energy exchange on tdyn\nbecause of the rapidly varying gravitational potential.\nThe end result of violent relaxation will be that the system arives in a quasi-static equilibrium\nstate1 in which its random motions provide the equivalent of \u201cpressure support\u201d against\ngravity. This equilibrium is known as virial equilibrium. The virial theorem states that\nany bound system of particles interacating via forces will obey\n\u00a8I = 2U + 4K, (39)\nwhere I is the moment of inertia of the system and U and K are the potential and kinetic\nenergy, respectively. If violent relaxation drives our collapsing perturbation toward virial\nequilibrium, i.e. steady state, then \u00a8I = 0, and we have\n2K+ U = 0 \u21d2 E = K+ U = \u2212K = U/2. (40)\nWe can now work out the \ufb01nal size of the collapsed and viralized dark matter halo by the\nfollowing argument. Recall that at t= tta all the energy was gravitational potential energy\nbecause the kinetic energy of all mass shells is zero. For a spherically symmetric distribution\n1No self-gravitating system is truly in equilibrium, but since trelax \u226btH we can think of it as e\ufb00ectively\nbeing in equilibrium since the timescale on which it evolves is so long.\n9\nFigure 4: Evolution of an over dense region in spherical top-hat approximation. Figure from\nPadmanabhan.\nof matter with constant density and size rta, the potential energy is\nUta = \u22123GM2\n5rta\n\u21d2 Eta = Uta + Kta = Uta = \u22123GM2\n5rta\n. (41)\nThe system will collapse and virialize at tcoll = tvir = 2tta, at which point it will have a size\nrvir. If the distribution of mass were uniform at this point, its potential energy would be\nlikewise\nUvir = \u22123GM2\n5rvir\n, (42)\nwhere rvir is the virial radiusof the collapsed object. The virial theorem then implies\nEvir = Uvir/2 = \u22123GM2\n5(2rvir) (43)\n10\nand since energy has to be conserved\nEvir = Eta \u21d2rvir = rta\n2 . (44)\nThe mean overdensity within rvir at tvir = tcoll is then\n1 + \u2206vir \u2261\u03c1(tvir)\n\u00af\u03c1(tvir) = \u03c1(tta) (rta/rvir)3\n\u00af\u03c1(tvir) = \u03c1(tta)\n\u00af\u03c1(2tta)\n(rta\nrvir\n)3\n= \u03c1(tta)\n\u00af\u03c1(tta)\n\u00af\u03c1(tta)\n\u00af\u03c1(2tta)\n(rta\nrvir\n)3\n. (45)\nBut from the sperhical collapse model we know that at tta (\u03b8= \u03c0)\n\u03c1(tta)\n\u00af\u03c1(tta) = 1 + \u03b4(tta) = 9\u03c02\n16 = 5.55, (46)\n(see e.g. Table 1), whereas\n\u00af\u03c1(tta)\n\u00af\u03c1(2tta) =\n(a(2tta)\na(tta)\n)3\n=\n((2tta\ntta\n)2/3)3\n= 4, (47)\nand\nrvir = rta\n2 \u21d2\n(rta\nrvir\n)3\n= 8, (48)\nso we \ufb01nally have\n1 + \u2206vir =\n9\u03c02/16\n\ued17\ued1a\ued19\ued18\n\u03c1(tta)\n\u00af\u03c1(tta)\n4\n\ued17 \ued1a\ued19 \ued18\n\u00af\u03c1(tta)\n\u00af\u03c1(2tta)\n8\n\ued17 \ued1a\ued19 \ued18(rta\nrvir\n)3\n= 18\u03c02 = 178. (49)\nThus we have derived the charachteristic or virial overdensityof a collapsed object \u2206vir \u2248\n178 in addition to the characteristic size rvir = rta/2. If \u2126 m \u0338= 1, the situation is slightly\nmore complicated, because then \u2206 vir depends on the \u2126 m(tvir) and \u2126 m(tvir/2). A useful\napproximation is given by\n\u2206vir = 18\u03c02 + 82x\u221239x2\n1 + x , (50)\nwhere x= \u2126m(tvir) \u22121 (from Bryan and Norman, 1998).\nFigure 4 illustrates the density pro\ufb01le evolution in the non-linear and linear regime, as well\nas the charachteristic scale factors and densities in the spherical collapse model.\n1.4 Dark Matter Halos\nIn the previous section we were able to determine that a collapsed region of sizervir containing\na mass M has average density which is \u224318\u03c02 larger than the cosmic mean density, that is\nMvir = \u03c1virV = 18\u03c02 \u00af\u03c1(t)4\u03c0\n3 r3\nvir = \u2206vir \u00af\u03c1(t)4\u03c0\n3 r3\nvir. (51)\n11\nThis result allows us to determine the characteristic size, density, velocity, and temperature\n(of the baryonic component) for a collapsed object of a given mass. These collapsed objects\nare known as dark matter halos.\nAlthough spherical collapse captures some of the physics governing the formation of halos,\nstructure formation in a cold dark matter universe proceeds hierarchically. At early times,\nmost of the dark matter was in low-mass halos, and these halos then continously accreted\nand merged to form high-mass halos. Using high-resolution N-body simulations to model\ngravitational instability of collisionless cold dark matter (CDM) particles with initial condi-\ntions drawn from the linear theory power spectrum P(k), Navarro et al. (1996) showed that\nthe spherically averaged density pro\ufb01les of the resulting halos are described by a roughly uni-\nversal function although there is considerable scatter among di\ufb00erent halos. This so-called\nNFW (short for Navarro-Frenk-White) pro\ufb01le has the form\n\u03c1(r) = \u03c1s\n(r/rs) (1 +r/rs)2 , (52)\nwhich is completely characterized by two parameters, mass Mvir and the concentration pa-\nrameter c = rvir/rs. Here rvir is related to Mvir via eqn. (51) and the spherical collapse\noverdensity \u2206vir. The quantity \u03c1s is given by\n\u03c1s = \u03c1m(z)\u2206vir\nc3\n3f(c), (53)\nwhere\n\u03c1m(z) = \u03c1crit(z)\u2126m(z) = (1 + z)3\u2126m0\n3H2\n0\n8\u03c0G, (54)\nand\nf(x) = ln(1 + x) \u2212 x\n1 + x. (55)\nThe corresonding mass pro\ufb01le is\nM(<r) = Mvir\nf(cx)\nf(c) ; x= r\nrvir\n. (56)\nThe concentration parameter c= c(M,z) is a function of the halo mass and time. Actually\nit is more appropriate to think of the concenration as a function of halo mass and formation\nredshift, since halos which collapse earlier are more dense. Various \ufb01tting formulae for\nc(M,z) can be found in the literature.\n2 Press-Schecter Formalism\nAccording to linear theory, the density \ufb01eld evolves as\n\u03b4(x,t) = D(t)\u03b40(x), (57)\n12\nwhere \u03b40(x) is the density \ufb01eld linearly extrapolated to t= t0, and D(t) is the linear growth\nrate normalized to unity at t = t0. For an Einstein de Sitter Universe D(a) = a since\na(t0) \u22611. The spherical collapse model taught us that if we linearly extrapolate the growth\nof perturbations forward in time regions with\n\u03b4(x,t) >\u03b4c \u22431.686, (58)\nwill have collapsed to produce dark matter haloes by time t. In this section, we examine\nhow we can assign a dark halo mass to some location in the linear density \ufb01eld which has\n\u03b4(x,t) >\u03b4c, as illustrated in Fig. 5.\nFigure 5: Schematic illustration of the linear theory density \ufb01eld along a slice in position.\nRegions that are above the linear theory collapse threshold \u03b4c = 1.686 should have collapsed\nto form dark matter halos.\nAccording to the spherical collapse model, regions with \u03b4(x,t) > \u03b4c will have collapsed to\nproduce dark matter halos by time t. We can also view this situation di\ufb00erently, exploiting\nthat \u03b4(x,t) = D(t)\u03b40(x), we can instead imagine that regions with\n\u03b40(x) > \u03b4c\nD(t), (59)\nwill have collapsed to produce dark matter halos by time t. In this latter case, we consider\nthe linear density \ufb01eld to be static at the value extrapolated to our reference time t0, while\nthe collapse barrier evolves with time, getting progressively lower as the growth factor\nD(t) increases with time toward unity. In the Press-Schechter formalism, this latter way of\nviewing the barrier as decreasing with time will be the preferred approach.\nPreviously, when discussing statistical measures of the density \ufb01eld, we de\ufb01ned the relative\n13\nmass excess\n\u03b4M(x) \u2261\u03b4MR\nMR\n=\n\u222b d3k\n(2\u03c0)3 \u03b4(k)W(k)eik\u00b7x, (60)\nwhich is just a smoothed version of the density \ufb01eld. We argued that the variance of this\nrandom \ufb01eld (two-point correlation at zero-lag) can be written\n\u03c32(R) = \u27e8\u03b42\nM(x)\u27e9=\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u22062(k)W2(k)dln k, (61)\nfrom the convolution theorem and the de\ufb01nition of the power spectrum. Two common\nchoices for \ufb01lter functions are the top-hat and the Gaussian\ntop-hat W(x) =\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n3\n4\u03c0R3 x\u2264R\n0 otherwise\n\u21d2 W(k) = 3\n(kR)3 [sin(kr) \u2212kRcos(kR)]\nGaussian W(x) = 1\n(2\u03c0)3/2R3 exp\n(\n\u2212x2\n2R2\n)\n\u21d2 W(k) = exp\n(\n\u2212k2R2\n2\n)\n. (62)\nThe mass associated with a the \ufb01lter of size R is\ntop-hat M = 4\u03c0R3\n3 \u00af\u03c1\nGaussian M = (2\u03c0)3/2R3 \u00af\u03c1, (63)\nwhich means that we can either label a \ufb01lter by its size R or its mass M.\nPreviously we argued that the mass variance is a good proxy for the progression of structure\nformation on a given scale, and noted that for a power law power spectrum P(k) = Akn the\nresulting scaling\n\u03c32\nM(R) \u221dR\u2212(n+3) \u221dM\u2212(n+3)/3, (64)\nimplies that small-scale structures go non-linear at earlier times, giving rise to hiearchical\nstructure formation. The mass variance as a function of scale R is shown in Fig. 6.\nBecause convolution is a linear operation, if \u03b4(x) is a Gaussian random \ufb01eld, then the same\nholds for the \ufb01ltered \ufb01eld \u03b4M(x). Thus we can write that the probability distribution of\n\u03b4M(x)\nP(\u03b4M)d\u03b4M = 1\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3M\nexp\n[\n\u2212\u03b42\nM\n2\u03c32\nM\n]\nd\u03b4M, (65)\nwhere we use the shorthand notation \u03b4M(x) \u2261\u03b4M and \u03c3M = \u03c3(M).\nThe idea behind the Press-Schechter model for the abundance of dark matter halos is ex-\nceedingly simple. Press & Schechter 1974 postulated that \u201cthe probability that \u03b4M > \u03b4c(t)\nis the same as the mass fraction that at time t is contained in halos with mass greater than\nM.\u201d The probability that \u03b4M >\u03b4c(t) can be easily calculated. For a Gaussian random \ufb01eld,\n14\nFigure 6: Mass \ufb02uctuations and collapse thresholds in cold dark matter models. The\nhorizontal dotted lines show the value of the extrapolated collapse overdensity \u03b4c(t) at the\nindicated redshifts. Also shown is the value of \u03c3(M) for a CDM model with the benchmark\nmodel cosmological parameters, as well as \u03c3(M) for a power spectrum with a cuto\ufb00 below\na mass M = 1.7 \u00d7108 M\u2299(short-dashed curve), or M = 1.7 \u00d71011 M\u2299(long-dashed curve).\nThe intersection of the horizontal lines with the \u03c3(M) curves indicate, at each redshift z,\nthe mass scale (for each model) at which a \ufb02uctuation is just collapsing at z, which is to say\nthat it indicates the value of the quantity M\u2217(t) de\ufb01ned in eqn. (77). Figure from Barkana\nand Loeb.\none has that\nP[\u03b4M >\u03b4c(t)] = 1\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3M\n\u222b \u221e\n\u03b4c(t)\nexp\n[\n\u2212\u03b42\nM\n2\u03c32\nM\n]\nd\u03b4M = 1\n2 erfc\n[ \u03b4c(t)\u221a\n2\u03c3M\n]\n, (66)\n15\nwhere erfc(x) = 1 \u2212erf(x) is the complimentary error function, and where again \u03b4c(t) = \u03b4c/\nD(t), such that the collapse barrier evolves downard with time. According to the Press\nSchecter postulate above, we thus have\nF(>M,t ) = 1\n2 erfc\n[ \u03b4c(t)\u221a\n2\u03c3M\n]\n. (67)\nThere is however a serious problem with the Press-Schecter postulate. As M \u21920, then\n\u03c3(M) \u2192 \u221e, as can be seen from the scaling relations in eqn. (64) (this assumes that\nn> \u22123, which is the case for CDM power spectra, hence \u03c3(M) will always be a decreasing\nfunction of M). As we discussed before, this scaling is what drives hierarchical structure\nformation, or the fact that in CDM collapse occurs from the bottom up. But as M \u21920,\nF(> M,t) \u2192 1/2, which suggests that only half of the mass in the universe is part of\ncollapsed objects of any mass. This necessarily results from the Press-Schecter postulate of\nassociating positive linear theory density \ufb02uctucations with collapsed structures, and the fact\nthat we are dealing with a Gaussian random \ufb01eld which is symmetric about zero, implying\nthat the cumulative probability for a positive density \ufb02uctuation is\nP(\u03b4 >0) = 1\n2. (68)\nIn linear theory, where \ufb02uctuations grow proportional to the linear growth rate \u03b4(x,t) \u221d\nD(a), the positive \ufb02uctuations become more positive, and the negative \ufb02uctuations become\nmore negative, and so there is no way for the half of the volume of the universe corresponding\nto negative \ufb02uctuations to contain collapsed objects. However, underdense regions can be\nenclosed within larger overdense regions, giving them a \ufb01nite probability of being included\nin a larger collapsed object, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Press & Schechter argued, without a\nproper demonstration, that the material in initially underdense regions will eventually be\naccreted by the collapsed objects, doubling their masses without changing the shape of the\nmass function. They thus \u2018solved\u2019 this problem by simply introducing a fudge factor of a\nfactor of 2, and instead adopted\nF(>M,t ) = 2P(\u03b4M >\u03b4c(t)) = erfc\n[ \u03b4c(t)\u221a\n2\u03c3M\n]\n. (69)\nThe quantity F(> M,t) gives the cumulative distribution of the masses at any time t. A\nmore useful quantity is the so-called mass function, which is the number density of dark\nmatter halos in the mass range M \u2192M + dM,\nn(M,t)dM. (70)\nAccordingly, if we assume, following the PS-postulate, that the entire mass density of the\nuniverse is comprised of collapsed dark matter halos distributed across mass according to\n16\nFigure 7: Schematic illustration of the linear theory density \ufb01eld along a slice in position.\nUnderdense regions that reside within larger overdense regions should have a \ufb01nite proba-\nbility of being included in some larger collapsed object, but this is not the case in the PS\nmodel where only \u03b4M >0 \ufb02uctuations every get incorporated into collapsed halos.\neqn.

(72)\nThis is known as the Press & Schechter (PS) mass function. Note that time enters eqn. (72)\nonly through \u03b4c(t) = \u03b4c/D(t), and that mass enters through \u03c3(M) and its derivative. If we\nde\ufb01ne the variable\n\u03bd \u2261 \u03b4c(t)\n\u03c3(M), (73)\nthe PS mass function can be written in a more compact form:\nn(M,t) = \u00af\u03c1\nM2 fPS(\u03bd)\n\u23d0\u23d0\u23d0\u23d0\ndln \u03bd\ndln M\n\u23d0\u23d0\u23d0\u23d0, (74)\nwhere\nfPS(\u03bd) =\n\u221a\n2\n\u03c0\u03bdexp\n(\u2212\u03bd2\n2\n)\n, (75)\n17\nis the multiplicity function which gives the fraction of the mass associated with halos in a\nunit range of ln \u03bd.\nFigure 8: PS dark matter mass function at several redshifts: z = 0 (solid curve), z = 5\n(dotted curve), z = 10 (short-dashed curve), z = 20 (long-dashed curve), and z = 30 (dot-\ndashed curve). Figure from Barkana and Loeb.\nThe PS formalism provides an extremely useful way to understand how nonlinear structure\nforms in a hierarchical model. As can be seen from eqn. (72), halos with mass M can only\nform in a signi\ufb01cant number when\n\u03c3(M) \u2273 \u03b4c(t). (76)\n18\nWe can de\ufb01ne a characterstic mass M\u2217(t) by the condition that\n\u03c3[M\u2217(t)] = \u03b4c(t) = \u03b4c\nD(t), (77)\nwhere \u03b4c = 1.686 is the linear collapse threshold from the spherical collapse model and D(t)\nis the linear growth factor. This can be visualized in Figure 6 where one sees that M\u2217(t)\nis the value of M at which the horizontal dotted lines indicating \u03b4c(t) at any t, intersects\n\u03c3(M). From the equations above and the PS mass function, we see that only halos with\nM \u2272 M\u2217can have formed in sign\ufb01cant number at a time t. Since D(t) increases with t, and\nin hierarchical CDM models, \u03c3(M) \u221dM\u2212(n+3)/6, is a decreasing function of M (see eqn. (64)\nwe get\nM\u2217(t) \u221dD6/(n+3)(t) \u221dD\u03b1(t), (78)\nfor a power law power spectrum P(k) \u221dkn. On mass scales between M \u22431012\u221214 h\u22121M\u2299,\nthe spectral index varies from about n \u2248\u22122 at the low-mass end to n \u2248\u22121.5. Thus the\nexponent above varies from \u03b1 \u22486 to \u03b1 \u22484, and is thus a strongly increasing function of\ntime. Thus, as time passes, more and more massive halos will start to go nonlinear and form.\nThe PS mass function is plotted in Fig. 8 for several di\ufb00erent redshifts. We see that the mass\nfunction has a power law form which is attenuated by an exponential at the higest masses.\nThe transition from power law to expontential occurs around the characteristic mass-scale\nM\u2217. Intuitively this exponential suppression for M \u226bM\u2217makes sense. Since at a time tan\nM\u2217 halo corresponds to a \u03b4M \u223c1.686/D(t) level positive \ufb02uctuation in the gaussian linear\ndensity \ufb01eld which has standard deviation \u03c3(M). A much larger mass would correspond to\na much rarer event in the initial conditions, which are are exponentially unlikely given the\nGaussian initial conditions.\n19"

Density \ufb02uctuations\npresent at the time of decoupling source \ufb02uctuations in the CMB temperature both through\ntheir coupling to the radiation \ufb01eld and through their perturbation of the space time metric.\nThis information is encoded in the power spectrum of temperature anisotropies which have\nbeen recently measured to unprecedented precision by the Planck satellite. The Planck all\nsky CMB map is shown in Fig. 1, and the temperature power spectrum is shown in Fig. 2.\nOur goal in this lecture is to relate the features in this power spectrum to what we have\nlearned so far about structure formation.\nFigure 1: The anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) as observed by\nPlanck.\n1 Spherical Harmonics\nObservations of the CMB provide us with microwave temperature maps of the entire sky.\nWe need to be able to deal with a continuous spectrum of temperature \ufb02uctuations, and the\nnatural way of doing this is to take the Fourier transform of the intensity distribution. The\ntemperature \ufb02uctuations are distributed over the surface of a sphere, and so we need the two-\ndimensional spherical polar equivalent of the relation between the density distribution and\nits power spectrum, which we derived previously when we related the amplitude of Fourier\nmodes to the power spectrum in three Cartesian dimensions. For the surface of a sphere,\nthe appropriate complete sets of orthonormal functions are the spherical harmonic functions.\nThe \ufb01rst step is to make a spherical harmonic expansion of the temperature \ufb02uctuation over\n1\nFigure 2: Left: The power spectrum of CMB temperature anisotropies as measured by\nPlanck shown with power on a linear scale. Right: The power spectrum of CMB temperature\nanisotropies measured by various di\ufb00erent experiments shown with power on a log scale.\nthe entire sky\n\u2206T\nT (\u02c6n) = T(\u02c6n) \u2212\u00afT\n\u00afT =\n\u221e\u2211\n\u2113=0\nm=\u2113\u2211\nm=\u2212\u2113\na\u2113mY\u2113m(\u02c6n), (1)\nwhere the Y\u2113m are the orthonormal functions known as the spherical harmonics of degree \u2113\nand order m, and the unit vector \u02c6n denotes some direction on the sky ( \u03b8,\u03c6). The spherical\nharmonics obey an orthonormality condition\n\u222b\n4\u03c0\nY\u2217\n\u2113mY\u2113\u2032m\u2032 d\u2126 = \u03b4\u2113\u2113\u2032 \u03b4mm\u2032 , (2)\nwhere the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate of the spherical harmonic and the integral\nis taken over the whole sky, that is, over d\u2126 = sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03c6, the element of solid angle. The \u03b4\u2019s\nare Kroenekcer delta functions which take the value of unity if \u2113= \u2113\u2032 and m= m\u2032, and are\nzero otherwise. From the orthogonality condition above, the values of the a\u2113m are found by\nmultiplying the temperature distribution by Y\u2217\n\u2113m and integrating over the sphere\na\u2113m =\n\u222b\n4\u03c0\n\u2206T\nT (\u02c6n)Y\u2217\n\u2113md\u2126. (3)\nSimilar to the cosmological density perturbation \u03b4(x), the observed CMB sky should be\nconsidered as one realization of a cosmological random \ufb01eld. For the density perturbation\nwe de\ufb01ned the power spectrum via the two-point correlation of the Fourier amplitudes, and\nused statistical isotropy and homogeneity to show that\n\u27e8\u03b4(k)\u03b4\u2217(k\u2032)\u27e9= (2\u03c0)3\u03b4D(k \u2212k\u2032)P(k). (4)\nWhat is the implication of statistical isotropy and homogeneity for the two-point correlation\n2\nof the a\u2113m? It turns out we must have\n\u27e8a\u2113ma\u2217\n\u2113\u2032m\u2032 \u27e9= C\u2113\u03b4\u2113\u2113\u2032 \u03b4mm\u2032 , (5)\nwhere C\u2113 is the angular power spectrum . By statistical isotropy there should be no\npreferred directions on the sky such that each of the (2 \u2113+ 1) coe\ufb03cients a\u2113m provides an\nindependent estimate of the amplitude of the temperature \ufb02uctuations associated with the\nmultipole \u2113. The power spectrum C\u2113 can thus be written\nC\u2113 = 1\n2\u2113+ 1\n\u2211\nm\na\u2113ma\u2217\n\u2113m = \u27e8|a\u2113m|2\u27e9. (6)\nEquivalent to the power spectrum description, we can de\ufb01ne an auto-correlation function of\nthe temperature \ufb02uctuations as\nC(\u03b8) =\n\u27e8\u2206T\nT (\u02c6n)\u2206T\nT (\u02c6n\u2032)\n\u27e9\n, (7)\nwhere cos(\u03b8) = \u02c6n \u00b7\u02c6n\u2032 is the angle between the two directions on the sky. The correlation\nfunction is related to the power spectrum C\u2113 by\nC(\u03b8) = 1\n4\u03c0\n\u2211\n\u2113\n(2\u2113+ 1)C\u2113P\u2113(cos \u03b8), (8)\nwhere P\u2113 is the Legendre polynomial of degree \u2113, and we have used eqn. (6) and properties\nof the spherical harmonics to derive this expression. It follows that the two point correlation\ndepends only on the angle between the two directions on the sky \u03b8, as required by statistical\nisotropy.\nNote that the variance of the temperature \ufb01eld is just the two-point correlation at zero-lag,\ni.e. C(0), which from above\nC(0) =\n\u27e8[\u2206T\nT (\u02c6n)\n]2\u27e9\n= \u03c32 =\n\u2211\n\u2113\n2\u2113+ 1\n4\u03c0 C\u2113 \u2248\n\u222b\ndln \u2113\u2113(\u2113+ 1)C\u2113\n2\u03c0 . (9)\nWe thus have an expression analogus to what we obtained in 3-d\n\u22062(k) = k3\n2\u03c02 P(k) = d\u03c32\ndln k, (10)\nwhere here we identify the quantity\n\u2113(\u2113+ 1)C\u2113\n2\u03c0 = d\u03c32\ndln \u2113, (11)\nas the dimensionless power spectrum, which is the amount of variance per logarithmic mul-\n3\ntipole interval dln \u2113. It is customary to plot the quantity\n\u22062\nT \u2261\u2113(\u2113+ 1)\n2\u03c0 C\u2113 \u00afT2, (12)\nwhich is actually the power spectrum of \u2206 T, since \u00afT2 has been multiplied in, and thus has\nunits of temperature squared, which is why the units of the power spectra in Figure 2 have\nunits of \u00b5K2.\nFinally, we will often need to know the relationship between multipole \u2113 and angular scale\n\u03b8. For small sections of the sky where its curvature can be neglected, the spherical harmonic\nanalysis becomes ordinary Fourier analysis on a \ufb02at two dimensional surface\n\u2206T\nT (n) =\n\u2211\na\u2113mY\u2113m \u2192\n\u222b\nd2\u2113\u2206T\nT (\u2113)ei\u2113\u00b7\u03b8, (13)\nwhere this \ufb02at-sky approximation is valid for \u2113 \u2273 100. For these high multipoles which\nare well described by standard Fourier analysis, the angular scale corresponding to a given\nharmonic is obviously given by \u03b8 = 2\u03c0/\u2113. For larger angular scales and lower multipoles,\nwhere the spherical harmonics di\ufb00er from Fourier modes, the angular scale corresponding to\nharmonic \u2113 is roughly given by\n\u03b8\u2113 \u2243\u03c0\n\u2113. (14)\nNote that the density \ufb02uctuations at decoupling are so small that they are de\ufb01nitely in the\nlinear regime. Since we believe that in\ufb02ation gave rise to Gaussian initial conditions, and\nsince we will see that the CMB temperature \ufb02uctuations are proportional to the density pe-\nrurbations, the CMB temperature \ufb02uctuation is a Gaussian random \ufb01eld, which implies that\nthe power spectrum C\u2113 (or equivalently the correlation function C(\u03b8)) provides a complete\nstatistical description of the \ufb02uctuation distribution. This assumption of the Gaussianity of\nthe CMB has been tested to high precision.\n2 Physical Origin of Anisotropies\n2.1 Overview\nWe will now proceed to consider the physical origin of CMB anisotropies. First, one must\ndistinguish between primary anisotropies which are generated at the last scattering sur-\nface, and secondary anisotropies, which are generated by processes like electron scattering\nor gravitational redshifts that occur along the line-of-sight as the CMB photons propagate\ntowards earth.\nPrimary Anisotropies There are three basic primary e\ufb00ects which are important on large,\nintermediate, and small angular scales, respectively. They are:\nSuperhorizon Fuctuations The Sachs-Wolfe e\ufb00ect is a source of temperature\nanisotropy due to gravitational parturbations at the last scattering surface. It generates\n4\nFigure 3: Illustration of the physical mechanisms that cause CMB anisotropies. The shaded\narc on the right represents the last-scattering shell. Inhomogeneities on this shell a\ufb00ects the\nCMB through its potential/density \ufb02uctuations on both super and sub-horizon scales. Non-\nzero velocities at last scattering give rise to Doppler perturbations. Further perturbations\nare added along the line of sight by time-varying potentials (ISW & Rees\u2013Sciama e\ufb00ect)\nand by electron scattering from hot gas (Sunyaev\u2013Zeldovich e\ufb00ect). The density \ufb01eld at last\nscattering can be Fourier analyzed into modes of wavevector k. These spatial perturbation\nmodes have a contribution that is in general damped by averaging over the shell of last\nscattering. Short-wavelength modes are more heavily a\ufb00ected (i) because more of them \ufb01t\ninside the scattering shell, and (ii) because their wavevectors point more nearly radially for\na given projected wavelength.\ntemperature anisotropies on a scale larger than the particle horizon at the last scat-\ntering surface. Since causal processes cannot in\ufb02uence perturbation evolution on these\nscales, the temperature anisotropy results from the impact of the density/potential\n\ufb02uctuations on the metric itself, making this a purely gravitational e\ufb00ect.\nSubhorizon Fluctuations Below the horizon scale at the last scattering surface,\ncausal processes like pressure forces and the propagation of sound waves can operate.\nThe tightly coupled baryon-photon \ufb02uid results in acoustic oscillations driven by the\ndark matter density/potential \ufb02uctuations. Since the photons are tightly coupled to\nthe baryons, the densities of the two \ufb02uids scale proportionately\nnb \u221dn\u03b3; n\u03b3 \u221dT3; \u21d2\u03c1b = nbmb \u221dT3, (15)\n5\nwhere the n\u03b3 \u221dT3 results from the fact that the photons are a black body radiation\n\ufb01eld. Di\ufb00erentiating \u03c1b \u221dT3, we \ufb01nd\n\u2206T\nT = 1\n3\n\u03b4\u03c1b\n\u03c1b\n= \u03b4b\n3 . (16)\nThus we see that \ufb02uctuations in the baryon density source CMB temperature anisotropies.\nThese are often referred to as isentropic or adiabatic perturbations, which is actually a\nstatement about the nature of the initial conditions on the modes before they entered\nthe horizon. These initial conditions are set by the physics of in\ufb02ation, and isen-\ntropic/adiabatic initial conditions mean that the ratio of matter to radiation, which is\nequivalent to the entropy per baryon, is conserved.\nDoppler Flucutations The photon-baryon \ufb02uid has a non-zero velocity at last-\nscattering. Scattering of CMB photons o\ufb00 of electrons with non-zero velocities leads\nto Doppler shifts in photon frequency and hence in the temperature of the CMB.\nSecondary Anisotropies There are three primary sources of secondary anisotropies. We\nwill not have time to discuss these and only mention them very brie\ufb02y:\nIntegrated Sachs Wolfe & Rees Sciama E\ufb00ectsresult from CMB photons travers-\ning time varying potentials along the line-of-sight. This sources additional temperature\nanisotropy.\nSunyaev-Zeldovich E\ufb00ect When CMB photons encounter hot plasma along the\nline-of-sight they will be Compton up scattered to higher frequencies. The largest SZ\nsignals are associated with foreground clusters of galaxies, which are large collapsed\nnon-linear structures at low-redshift which have plasma temperatures of T \u2243107 K.\nThomson Scattering from ReionizationWhen the universe is reionized atz \u22437\u22128\nthe free electrons can Thompson scatter CMB photons. This has as a small e\ufb00ect on\nthe temperature anisotropy pattern, but results in a large e\ufb00ect on the polarization\nof the CMB, since Thompson scattering of a quadropole anisotropy produces linear\npolarization.\nOur strategy for understanding CMB anisotropies will be to start with the largest angular\nscales and progress to smaller scales. We will \ufb01rst learn about the Sachs-Wolfe e\ufb00ect, which is\nthe dominant source of large angular scale anisotropy. Moving to smaller sub-horizon angular\nscales brings in causal processes which complicates analysis. We will attempt to understand\nsome of the characteristic behavior like the origin of the acoustic peaks at intermediate\nangular scales and the damping of \ufb02uctuations on small-angular scales. Finally, we will\nconclude by describing how a full numerical calculation of the CMB power spectrum is\nperformed by solving the Boltzmann equation, which will help us better understand the\ncomplexity of the physics.\n6\n2.2 Large Angular Scales\n2.2.1 The Particle Horizon\nOn the homework you computed the particle horizon at decoupling, and we similarly calcu-\nlated this quantity when discussing in\ufb02ation\nrph(tdec) =\n\u222b tdec\n0\ncdt\na(t) = 274 cMpc. (17)\nThis comoving distance corresponds to a proper distance ofdph = adecdph(tdec) = 0.251 Mpc \u223c\nctdec at tdec. We previously found that dA(tdec) = 12 .8 Mpc, and hence a patch of the last\nscattering surface with size equal to the particle horizon will subtend an angle\n\u03b8ph = rph(tdec)\ndA(tdec)(1 + zdec) = 1.1\u25e6 \u21d2 \u2113ph = \u03c0\n\u03b8ph\n= 163. (18)\nThus any \ufb02uctuation with multipole \u2113\u2272 160 represents a super-horizon temperature \ufb02uctu-\nation.\nWhen we discussed structure formation, we argued that evolution of super-horizon modes\ndi\ufb00ers signi\ufb01cantly from sub-horizon modes. Whereas we could analyze the behavior of sub-\nhorizon \ufb02uctuations using Newtonian mechanics, as expressed by the Euler and continuity\nequations, we argued that super-horizon \ufb02uctuations evolve di\ufb00erently. A super-horizon\nmode is not in causal contact with itself, and so things like sound waves cannot propagate\nacross it. In GR perturbation theory, the gravitational potential of these \ufb02uctuations is the\nperturbation to the metric, and thus we have the result that for these modes the potential\nperturbation is constant in time.\nWhen we discussed the shape of the matter power spectrum P(k), we argued that what\nwere super-horizon modes are constantly entering the horizon as the Universe expands be-\ncause the horizon grows with time faster than the proper length scale (or equivalently, a\ncomoving length scale stays \ufb01xed with time but the comoving particle horizon grows with\nthe expansion). Analogously, because the universe expanded by a factor of \u223c1000 since tdec,\nwe are now able to see many horizon size \u223c1\u25e6 patches of the CMB that were not in causal\ncontact with each other. The \ufb02uctuations on these scales retain their primordial character\nsince they will not have been modi\ufb01ed by any causal processes inside the horizon before tdec.\nThese frozen in potential \ufb02uctuations thus contain unique information about the form of the\nunprocessed initial power spectrum of \ufb02uctuations put in place by in\ufb02ation. These can be\ndirectly measured via the Sachs-Wolfe e\ufb00ect, as we discuss next.\n2.2.2 The Sachs-Wolfe E\ufb00ect\nOn large scales the dominant contribution to \u2206 T/T is the Sachs\u2013Wolfe e\ufb00ect. This is\na relativistic e\ufb00ect due to the fact that photons travelling to an observer from the last\nscattering surface encounter metric perturbations which cause them to change frequency.\nThe Sachs-Wolfe e\ufb00ect is actually a manifestation of two releativistic e\ufb00ects.\n7\nGravitational Redshift Imagine an overdensity at recombination which gives rise to a\ngravitational potential \ufb02ucutation \u03b4\u03a6. First there will be a gravitational redshift resulting\nfrom the density \ufb02uctuations, and at decoupling the temperature re\ufb02ects a snapshot of the\npotential well the photons were in at the time of last scattering\nEinit + \u03b4\u03a6\n(Einit\nc2\n)\n\ued19 \ued18\ued17 \ued1a\nphoton \u201cmass\u201d\n= E\ufb01nal\n\u21d2\u03b4E\nE = \u03b4\u03a6\nc2 . (19)\nBut the photons obey the Bose-Einstein distribution function\nfBE = 1\neE/(kBT) \u22121, (20)\nwhich is a conserved quantity. So this implies\n\u03b4T\nT = \u03b4\u03a6\nc2 . (21)\nThus in an overdense region ( \u03b4\u03a6 < 0) there will be a net decrease of temperature \u03b4T <0\ndue to the gravitational redshift of the photons.\nTime Dilation In the limit of weak \ufb01elds, one can write the perturbed FRW metric as\nds2 = \u2212(1 + 2\u03a6/c2)dt2 + a(t)(1 \u22122\u03a6/c2)\n[\ndx2 + dy2 + dz2]\n, (22)\nwhere the coordinate time tis the cosmic time of the background unperturbed model. Com-\npare a clock in the region with a potential perturbation \u03b4\u03a6 to one in the background unper-\nturbed \u03b4\u03a6 = 0 universe. To calculate the proper time interval d\u03c4 in this perturbed universe,\nwe want to evaluate the metric at \ufb01xed spatial coordinates dx= dy= dz = 0, which implies\nd\u03c42 = \u2212ds2 =\n(\n1 + 2\u03a6\nc2\n)\ndt2 \u21d2 d\u03c4 =\n\u221a\n1 + 2\u03a6\nc2 dt\u2248\n(\n1 + \u03a6\nc2\n)\ndt \u21d2 \u03c4 =\n(\n1 + \u03a6\nc2\n)\nt,\n(23)\nso we conclude that in an overdense region ( \u03b4\u03a6 <0) clocks run slower.\n\u03b4t\nt = \u03b4\u03a6\nc2 (24)\nBut this implies that the universe has expanded less, and is thus denser than average and\nthat must also mean that it is hotter since\nT \u221da\u22121 \u21d2 dT\nda = \u2212T\na, (25)\n8\nso we have \u03b4T\nT = \u2212\u03b4a\na . (26)\nBut for a matter dominated universe\na(t) \u221dt2/3 \u21d2 \u03b4a\na = 2\n3\ndt\nt . (27)\nCombining the three equations above we \ufb01nd\n\u03b4T\nT = \u2212\u03b4a\na = \u22122\n3\ndt\nt = \u22122\n3\n\u03b4\u03a6\nc2 . (28)\nThe physical interpretation is that because clocks run slower in an ovedense region (\u03b4\u03a6 <0),\nthe universe will be younger and thus e\ufb00ectively hotter \u03b4T > 0. Note that this has the\nopposite sign of the gravitational redshift term above.\nHence we learn that that the net temperature anisotropy generated from the Sachs-Wolfe\ne\ufb00ect is (\u03b4T\nT\n)\nSW\n=\n(\u03b4T\nT\n)\ntime\n+\n(\u03b4T\nT\n)\ngrav\n= \u22122\n3\n\u03b4\u03a6\nc2 + \u03b4\u03a6\nc2 = 1\n3\n\u03b4\u03a6\nc2 (29)\n2.2.3 Measuring the Primordial Power Spectrum\nWe can now understand why the dimensionless power spectrum \u22062\nT \u221d\u21132C\u2113 is essentially \ufb02at\nat low \u2113\u2272 100. In order to relate eqn. (29) to the CMB power spectrum we need to do a bit\nof math. By expanding the potential into Fourier modes\n\u03b4\u03a6(x,t) =\n\u222b d3k\n(2\u03c0)3 \u03b4\u03a6(k,t)eik\u00b7x, (30)\nand recalling that the perturbed Poisson equation \u22072\u03b4\u03a6 = 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c10\u03b4 we have\nk2\u03b4\u03a6 = \u22124\u03c0Ga2\u03c10\u03b4 \u21d2 P\u03b4 \u221dk4P\u03a6(k), (31)\nwhere P\u03b4 is the power spectrum of density \ufb02uctuations. Expanding the net Sachs-Wolfe\ntemperature perturbation in eqn. (29) in spherical harmonics, and averaging over all possible\nobserver positions yields, after some math\nC\u2113 = \u27e8|a\u2113m|2\u27e9= 1\n2\u03c0\n(H0\nc\n)4 \u222b \u221e\n0\nP\u03b4(k)j\u2113(kx)dk\nk2 , (32)\nwhere j\u2113 is a spherical Bessel function and x= 2c/H0. Assuming that in\ufb02ation gives rise to\na power law primordial power spectrum P(k) = Akn the expression above is analytic. It is\nthen straightforward to show that the dimensionless power spectrum\n\u2113(\u2113+ 1)C\u2113\n2\u03c0 \u2243const, (33)\n9\nfor the scale-free case n = 1, which are the initial conditions setup by in\ufb02ation which give\nrise to \u2206 2\n\u03a6 = k3P\u03a6(k)/2\u03c02 = const. Thus we see that the CMB power spectrum on large\nscales is directly related to the amplitude and slope of the primordial power spectrum 1\nFigure 4 illustrates how the large angle \u2113 \u2272 100 CMB power spectrum is used to measure\nthe large-scale linear theory matter power spectrum P(k).\n10-4 10-3 10-2 10-1 100\nWavenumber k [hMpc\u22121]\n100\n101\n102\n103\n104\nPm(k) [(h\u22121Mpc)3]\nPlanck TT\nPlanck EE\nPlanck \nSDSS DR7 LRG\nBOSS DR9 Ly-  forest\nDES Y1 cosmic shear\nFigure 4: The (linear theory) matter power spectrum (at z = 0) inferred from di\ufb00erent\ncosmological probes. From the Planck website.\n2.3 Intermediate Angular Scales: The Acoustic Peaks\n2.3.1 The Sound Horizon\nBefore we delve into the physics of the acoustic oscillations, we will calculate the characterstic\nlength scale below which they operate, which is the sound horizon at the last scattering\nsurface. This is the maximum distance which sound waves could travel and undergo coherent\noscillations. By analogy with the particle horizon it is de\ufb01ned as the comoving distance\nrs(tdec) =\n\u222b tdec\n0\ncsdt\na(t), (34)\n1The so-called integrated Sachs-Wolfe e\ufb00ect makes this slightly more complicated, but we ignore that\norder \u223c10% e\ufb00ect here.\n10\nwhich corresponds to the proper distance rs,prop = adecrs(tdec) \u223c cstdec, where cs is the\nsound speed of the photon-baryon \ufb02uid. The sound horizon therefore sets an upper limit\nto the wavelengths which acoustic waves could have at the epoch of recombination. In the\nhomework you showed that the sound speed of the photon-baryon \ufb02uid can be written\ncs =\n(\u2202P\n\u2202\u03c1\n)1/2\nS\n= c\u221a\n3\n[3\u03c1b\n4\u03c1\u03b3\n+ 1\n]\u22121/2\n= c\u221a\n3 (1 +R)\n, (35)\nwhere\nR(zdec) = 3\u03c1b\n4\u03c1\u03b3\n= 3\u2126b0\u03c1critc4\n16\u03c3T4\n0 (1 + zdec) = 3.045 \u00d7104 \u2126b0h2\n(1 + zdec) = 0.685, (36)\nfor our reference parameters at zdec = 1090, where \u03c3is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Thus\nthe speed of sound at the last scattering layer was cs = 0.445c, whereas at earlier times when\nthe universe is radiation dominated cs \u2243c/\n\u221a\n3 = 0.577c, which is the sound speed of a fully\nrelativistic plasma. It is reasonable to just approximate cs \u2248c/\n\u221a\n3 in eqn. (34), from which\nwe \ufb01nd that rs \u2248rph/\n\u221a\n3\nrs(tdec) =\n\u222b tdec\n0\ncsdt\na(t) \u2248 1\u221a\n3\n\u222b tdec\n0\ncdt\na(t) = 158 cMpc, (37)\nor a proper size of dph = 0.145 Mpc, which implies\n\u03b8s = rs(tdec)\ndA(tdec)(1 + zdec) = 0.7\u25e6 \u21d2 \u2113s = \u03c0\n\u03b8s\n= 280. (38)\nThe size of the sound horizon at decoupling sets the characteristic angular scale of the\nacoustic peaks seen in the CMB power spectrum in Fig. 2.\nInspection of the CMB power spectra in Fig. 2 indicates that the \ufb01rst peak in the power\noccurs at around this multipole, and that the other peaks in the spectrum occur at what\nappear to be harmonics of this multipole. The reason for this is that on small scales below\nthe sound horizon, the amplitude of the Fourier modes exhibit temporal oscillations. Modes\nthat are caught at maxima or minima of their oscillation at tdec correspond to peaks in the\npower. Because sound takes half as long to travel half as far, modes corresponding to peaks\nfollow a harmonic relationship. Let\u2019s try to understand the physics of this in more detail.\n2.3.2 Acoustic Oscillations\nOur analysis in this section will be necessarily approximate and aims to heuristically illustrate\nthe basic physics behind the acoustic oscillations. The full treatment requires solving the\nBoltzmann equation in GR, which is beyond the scope of this course, although we sketch\nout the general approach in the next section. Unlike our analysis of the SW e\ufb00ect, on sub-\nhorizon scales causal processes related to the motion of the \ufb02uid in the DM potential wells,\nthe compensating pressure gradients, and the resulting sound waves all have time to operate.\nPreviously we discussed the coupled perurbations of dark matter and the tightly coupled\nphoton-baryon \ufb02uid before recombination in the context of linear perturbation theory. We\n11\nwrote down the following equations:\n\u00a8\u03b4c + 2H\u02d9\u03b4c = 4 \u03c0G(\u03c1c\u03b4c + \u03c1b\u03b4b) \u22484\u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c (39)\n\u00a8\u03b4b + 2H\u02d9\u03b4b = \u2212c2\nsk2\na2 \u03b4b + 4\u03c0G(\u03c1c\u03b4c + \u03c1b\u03b4b) \u2248\u2212c2\nsk2\na2 + 4\u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c, (40)\nwhere in the last equality we have assumed that the dark matter dominates the matter\ncontent. Since the dark matter dominates the gravity and the expansion rate, the universe\nis Einstein-de Sitter and matter dominated, and eqn. (39) for the dark matter yields the\ngrowing solution \u03b4\u221da(t) which we studied before. Thus the 4\u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c in the baryon evolution\nequation can be thought of as an external driving term. Given the pressure term in the\nevolution equation for the baryons, the Jeans scale \u03bbJ \u2243csH\u22121 \u223ccH\u22121 is comparable to\nthe sound horizon \u2013 we expect to see acoustic oscillations.\nSince here we are focusing on the acoustic oscillations, the timescale of interest is the sound\ncrossing time\nts = \u03bb\ncs\n\u223c a\nkcs\n, (41)\nand in our approximate treatment we can thus ignore the Hubble drag term in eqn. (40)\nrelative to the other terms involving \u03b4b, i.e.\n2H\u02d9\u03b4b \u223c\n\u02d9\u03b4b\nt \u226a\u00a8\u03b4b \u223c\u03b4b\nt2\ns\n; 2 H\u02d9\u03b4b \u226ak2c2\ns\na2 \u03b4b \u223c\u03b4b\nt2\ns\n. (42)\nWe can also use the perturbed Poisson equation for the dark matter\n\u22072\u03b4\u03a6c = 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c1c\u03b4c \u21d2 \u2212k2\u03b4\u03a6c(k,t) = 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c1c\u03b4c(k,t), (43)\nto replace 4\u03c0G\u03c1c\u03b4c with \u2212k2\u03b4\u03a6c(k,t)/a2. Thus we can \ufb01nally recast the evolution equation\nfor the baryons (eqn. (40)) as\n\u00a8\u03b4b + k2c2\ns\na2 \u03b4b = \u2212k2\na2 \u03b4\u03a6c. (44)\nNow note that at early times around recombination, the universe will be matter dominated\nand Einstein-de Sitter with \u2126 tot = 1, and in this regime we showed previously that linear\ntheory predicts the potential perturbation does not evolve with time, so \u03b4\u03a6c(k,t) = \u03b4\u03a6c(k).\nThe equation above is thus the equation of motion for a forced harmonic oscillator, with a\nconstant forcing term. It admits solutions of the form\n\u03b4b(k,\u03b7) =\n[\n\u03b4b(k,0) + \u03b4\u03a6c\nc2\ns\n]\ncos(kcs\u03b7) + 1\nkcs\nd\u03b4b\nd\u03b7(k,0) sin(kcs\u03b7) \u2212\u03b4\u03a6c\nc2\ns\n, (45)\nwhere we have introduced the conformal time as the new time variable,\n\u03b7=\n\u222b t\n0\ndt\na(t); rs = cs\u03b7, (46)\n12\nand have noted that the sound horizon is equal to the product of the sound speed and the\nconformal time. This equation states that \u03b4b(k,t) oscillates around a zero-point, \u2212\u03b4\u03a6c/c2\ns,\nwith a frequency equal to \u03c9= kcs, and with amplitude and phase set by the initial conditions\n\u03b4b(k,t = 0) and d\u03b4b/d\u03b7(k,t = 0).\nThe motion of the photon-baryon \ufb02uid will also source anisotropies due electron scattering.\nUsing the perturbed continuity equation in k-space\n\u02d9\u03b4b + 1\na\u2207\u00b7\u03b4vb = 0 \u21d2ik \u00b7vb = \u2212a\u02d9\u03b4b, (47)\nwe can also obtain the time evolution of the corresponding baryon velocity perturbations\nvb(k,t) = ik\nk2\nd\u03b4b\nd\u03b7 = \u2212icsk\nk\n[\n\u03b4b(k,0) + \u03b4\u03a6c\nc2\ns\n]\nsin(kcs\u03b7) + ik\nk2\nd\u03b4b\nd\u03b7(k,0) cos(kcs\u03b7). (48)\nNote that there is a phase di\ufb00erence of \u03c0/2 between the velocity and density perturbations,\nas is characteristic of a longitudinal acoustic wave.\nHow can we relate these density and velocity perturbations to the CMB temperature anisotropy\n\u2206T/T? First note that, as discussed at the beginning of \u00a72.1, the CMB anistropy is sourced\nby multiple terms, namely the gravitational or SW e\ufb00ect, ansitropy due to baryon \ufb02uctua-\ntions, and Doppler shifts sourced by velocity \ufb02uctuations\n\u2206T\nT (k,t) =\n(\u2206T\nT\n)\ngrav\n+\n(\u2206T\nT\n)\n\u03c1\n+\n(\u2206T\nT\n)\nv\n= \u03b4\u03a6(k,t)\nc2 + \u03b4b(k,t)\n3 + 1\u221a\n3\n|vb|\nc , (49)\nwhere we have included the Sachs-Wolfe gravitational redshift term (\u2206 T/T)grav = \u03b4\u03a6(k,t)/\nc2, and used the relationship (\u2206 T/T)\u03c1 = \u03b4b/3 that we derived in eqn. (16). For the Doppler\nvelocity perturbation, we have used the fact that all three spatial directions should have the\nsame rms value of the velocity, and so the Doppler line-of-sight contribution resulting from\nthe motion of the \ufb02uid is just (\u2206T\nT\n)\nv\n= v\u2225\nc = |vb|\u221a\n3 . (50)\nLet\u2019s focus on the \ufb01rst two terms \ufb01rst, namely the sum of the gravitational and density\ncontributions to the anisotropy. These two terms \u2013 typically called the \u201ce\ufb00ective temperature\n\ufb02uctuation\u201d \u2013 re\ufb02ect the observed temperature \ufb02uctuation due to gravitational redshifting\nof photons as they climb out of potential wells and compression/rarefaction of the gas\n(\u2206T\nT\n)\ne\ufb00\n\u2261\n(\u2206T\nT\n)\ngrav\n+\n(\u2206T\nT\n)\n\u03c1\n= \u03b4\u03a6(k,t)\nc2 + \u03b4b(k,t)\n3 . (51)\nPlugging in our solution for \u03b4b from eqn. (45) above we obtain\n(\u2206T\nT\n)\ne\ufb00\n= \u03b4\u03a6c\nc2 +\n[\u03b4b(k,0)\n3 + \u03b4\u03a6c\n3c2\ns\n]\ncos(kcs\u03b7) + 1\n3kcs\nd\u03b4b\nd\u03b7(k,0) sin(kcs\u03b7) \u2212\u03b4\u03a6c\n3c2\ns\n. (52)\n13\nNow using cs = c/\n\u221a\n3 (1 +R), we can write this solution as\n(\u2206T\nT\n)\ne\ufb00\n= [\u03980(k,0) + (1 +R)\u03a8] cos(kcs\u03b7) + 1\nkcs\nd\u03980\nd\u03b7 (k,0) sin(kcs\u03b7) \u2212R\u03a8, (53)\nwhere we have introduced the new variables \u0398 0 = \u03b4b/3 and \u03a8 = \u03b4\u03a6c. Likewise, using\neqn. (50) the Doppler component of the perturbation can be written\n(\u2206T\nT\n)\nv\n=\n\u221a\n3cs\nc\n[\n\u03980(k,0) + (1 +R)\u03a8\nc2\n]\nsin(kcs\u03b7) \u2212\n\u221a\n3\nk\nd\u03980\nd\u03b7 (k,0) cos(kcs\u03b7). (54)\nFor the moment, let us focus on the e\ufb00ective temperature \ufb02uctuation, i.e. the gravity plus\ndensity term, which turns out to dominate the power. It is clear from the form of eqn. (53),\nthat the form of the acoustic oscillations is governed by the two initial conditions\n\u03980(k,0) and d\u03980\nd\u03b7 (k,0), (55)\nat time \u03b7 = 0. Inspection of eqn. (53) begs the question: why should there be any acoustic\noscillations at all? When we observe the CMB at decoupling, we are basically taking a\nsnapshot of the radiation \ufb01eld at \u03b7= \u03b7dec, which amounts to evaluating (\u2206T/T)e\ufb00(\u03b7= \u03b7dec).\nIf we superpose a large collection of modes with di\ufb00erent wavelengths (wavenumbers k) and\narbitrary phase (i.e. set by the values of the initial conditions \u0398 0(k,0) and d\u03980/d\u03b7(k,0)),\nthis should not result in a preferred scale that produces peaks in the power spectrum. Why\ndo we observe peaks in the CMB power spectrum?\nTo answer this question we \ufb01rst need to to be more clear about what we mean by \u201cinitial\nconditions\u201d, that is what time is \u03b7= 0? The initial conditions for these acoustic oscillations\nshould be set at the time at which causal physics begins to operate, in other words what\nwe mean by \u03b7 = 0 is actually the time at which a given mode entered the horizon. It turns\nout that in\ufb02ation can only excite so-called isentropic perturbations for which the ratio of\nthe matter and radiation is a constant at horizon entry. These correspond to pure curvature\n\ufb02uctuations or perturbations to the metric on super-horizon scales. They are called isentropic\nbecause a constant ratio of radiation to matter implies that the entropy per baryon s/nB is\nconstant. The alternative are so-called isocurvature perturbations for which the entropy\nper baryon can \ufb02uctuate from point to point. This is achieved by for example allowing the\nbaryon density to \ufb02uctuate on a \ufb01xed radiation backround. We won\u2019t be able to go into\nmore detail about how these \ufb02uctuations are classi\ufb01ed, but the upshot is that isentropic\n\ufb02uctuations only excite the cosine term in eqn. (53) at horizon entry, in other words we have\n\u03980(k,0) = const; d\u03980\nd\u03b7 (k,0) = 0, (56)\nwhich corresponds to an initial metric perturbation, whereas isocurvature \ufb02uctuations excite\nthe sine mode at horizon entry, which corresponds to zero initial metric perturbation. Now\n14\nrecall the de\ufb01nition of the conformal time \u03b7\n\u03b7=\n\u222b t\n0\ndt\u2032\na(t\u2032) \u21d2 rph(t) = c\u03b7. (57)\nThus for a given mode k, horizon crossing occurs at\nrph[\u03b7h(k)] = c\u03b7h(k) = 2\u03c0\nk \u21d2 \u03b7h(k) = 2\u03c0\nck. (58)\nThe important thing to note is that the phase of an acoustic wave at horizon crossing is\nphase = kcs\u03b7h(k) \u223c1, (59)\nis a constant of order unity which is independent of k. Thus, the zero point of the phase of\nevery mode can be consistently set at horizon crossing, such that e\ufb00ectively all the modes\nare setup with some initial amplitude of the cosine term in eqn. (53).\nThat fact that in\ufb02ation \u201clines up the phases\u201d allows us to now understand what gives rise\nto the peaks in the CMB power spectrum. Given a collection of modes with wavenumber\nk, there will be a speci\ufb01c set of modes that have exactly the right phase at \u03b7dec such that\nthey result in a compression or a rarefaction at the time of decoupling when the CMB is\nreleased, as illustrated in Fig. 5. The lowest \u2113 acoustic peak in the CMB power spectrum,\ncorresponding to the largest wavelength mode, will occur for the mode which has one-half\nwavelength equal to the sound horizon\nk1rs = k1cs\u03b7dec = \u03c0, (60)\nwhere in the last equality we used that the sound horizon is just rs = cs\u03b7dec. The other\nhigher-\u2113(and higher k) peaks in the CMB power are modes that are integer multiples of k1,\nwhich will also result in maximum compression or rarefaction at decoupling\nkncs\u03b7dec = n\u03c0 \u21d2 kn = n\u03c0\nrs\n= nk1, (61)\nThis is analogous to the condition for the resonant frequencies for standing waves in a\npipe which is closed at each end, such that the pressure perturbation achieves maximum\ncompression/rarefaction at the boundaries, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Since the power spectrum\nis e\ufb00ectively the square of the temperature perturbation \u03b4T/T, both maxima (hot spots) and\nminima (cold spots) give rise to peaks in the power spectrum, as illustrated by Fig. 6\nNow that we have understood the basic physical picture for the origin of the acoustic peaks,\nwe can gain further insight into the shape of the CMB power spectrum with just a little\nmore work. We argued that only the cosine term is excited, thus\n(\u2206T\nT\n)\ne\ufb00\n=\n[\n\u03980(k,0) + (1 +R)\u03a8\nc2\n]\ncos(kcs\u03b7) \u2212R\u03a8\nc2 . (62)\nTo determine the initial condition \u0398 0(k,0) we consider the behavior of the equation above\n15\nas \u03b7 \u21920. This corresponds to horizon entry, at which time the causal physics that gives\nrise to the acoustic oscillations and the Doppler shifts that result from electron scattering,\nwill not have time to operate. That is, at the earliest times our solution needs to be equal\nto the Sachs-Wolfe anistropy that we derived previously, which implies\n\u03980(k,0) + \u03a8\nc2 = 1\n3\n\u03a8\nc2 \u21d2 \u03980(k,0) = \u22122\n3\n\u03a8\nc2 . (63)\nRecall that \u03a8 is a constant in time (recall density perutrbations grow as a, but potentials\nare constant) if the universe is matter dominated. So we can \ufb01nally write the solution for\nthe e\ufb00ective temperature anisotropy\n(\u2206T\nT\n)\ne\ufb00\n(\u03b7dec) = \u03a8\n3c2 (1 + 3R) cos(krs) \u2212R\u03a8\nc2 . (64)\nFor the Doppler term we have\n(\u2206T\nT\n)\nv\n(\u03b7dec) = \u03a8\n3c2\n(1 + 3R)\n(1 + R)1/2 sin(krs), (65)\nwhere, similar to our analysis for (\u2206 T/T)e\ufb00, we used the initial conditions in eqns. (56)\nand (63). Therefore, the amplitude of the temperature \ufb02uctuation given by a Fourier mode\nwith wavenumber k is determined by \u03a8, R, and the phase krs of the acoustic wave at the\nlast-scattering surface.\nUsing these solutions we can explain multiple observed properties of the CMB power spec-\ntrum:\nAssyemtric peak heights Evaluating (\u2206T/T)e\ufb00 at the peaks which have k = n\u03c0/rs we\nsee that\n\u23d0\u23d0\u23d0\u23d0\n(\u2206T\nT\n)\ne\ufb00\n\u23d0\u23d0\u23d0\u23d0=\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\n|\u03a8|\n3c2 (1 + 6R) ( n= odd)\n|\u03a8|\n3c2 (n= even),\n(66)\nand the odd harmonics will have higher amplitude than the even harmonics. Inspection of\nFig. 8 illustrates that this is indeed the case for the magenta curve (labeled SW) which shows\nthe (\u2206T/T)e\ufb00 contribution. This enhancement of the odd peaks relative to the even peaks\noccurs because the odd peaks correspond to compressions of the sound waves, and the inerita\nof the baryons (as quanti\ufb01ed by the Rfactor) enhances these relative to the rarefactions.\nThe Doppler anisotropy should be \u03c0/2 out of phase with the e\ufb00ective temperature\nanistropy, because of the cos( krs) vs sin( krs), which we see is the case in Fig. 8 (blue\ncurve). Furthemore, the amplitude at the peaks of the Doppler term will not be as large as\nthe e\ufb00ective temperature term. As such, in the CMB power spectrum C\u2113 the Doppler term\npeaks \ufb01ll the valleys between the peaks of e\ufb00ective temperature rather than appearing as\npeaks themselves.\nCosmological parameter dependencies The CMB has many strong dependencies on\n16\np2pp31stacoustic peakfluid compressionin potential wells\n2ndacoustic peakfluid compressionin potential hills\n3rdacoustic peakfluid compressionin potential wellswellhill\ntimedT/T\nbaryon photon fluid propagated this far since Big Bang  \nFigure 5: Illustration of why certain modes will result in acoustic peaks in the CMB.

Because the sound horizon rs can\nbe computed from \ufb01rst principles, it amounts to a standard ruler. Given that we can also\ncalculate the redshift of decoupling from \ufb01rst principles, we can use this standard ruler\nrs and the known redshift of decoupling zdec to determine the angular diameter distance\nto the surface of last scattering DA(zdec). Because the angular diameter distance varies\nconsiderably for an open, \ufb02at, or closed universe k = 0,1,\u22121, the location of the \ufb01rst peak\nalone determines the the geometry of the metric. Information about \u2126 b0 is encoded in the\nrelative heights of the peaks. Since eqn. (66) indicates that the height of the odd peaks\ndepends on R\u221d \u2126b0, whereas the height of the even peaks are not sensitive to Rand hence,\nthe relative heights of the peaks is sensitive to \u2126 b0.\n2.4 Small Angular Scales\n2.4.1 The Last Scattering Layer\nThe CMB comes to us from the last scattering surface at z \u22431100.

Figure from Hu arXiv:0802.3688.\nreaction freezes out\n\u0393T(T) = ne\u03c3Tc= H(T), (67)\nwhere ne is the electron density and \u03c3T is the Thompson scattering cross section.\nA more accurate derivation of the redshift of decoupling, which you will explore in the\nhomework, can be obtained by de\ufb01ning an optical depth of Thomson scattering from an\nobserver at z = 0 to a surface at a redshift z:\n\u03c4(z) =\n\u222b z\n0\nne\u03c3T\ndl\ndzdz, (68)\nwhere dl is an in\ufb01tesimal element of proper distance along the light cone to redshift z.\nBut ne = Xe\u03b7n\u03b3, where Xe is the ionized fraction, and \u03b7 is the baryon to photon ration,\nand n\u03b3 is the number density of photons, so one can use Xe(z) computed from a full non-\nequilibrium (i.e. Boltzmann) recombination calculation to determine \u03c4(z). The optical depth\nis a measure of the number of mean free paths traversed between two distances, here between\nthe observer at redshift z = 0 and some location z. Thus the probability that a photon was\nlast scattered in the redshift interval z\u00b1dz/2 can be expressed in terms of the visibility\nfunction\nP(z) = e\u2212\u03c4d\u03c4\ndz, (69)\nwhich is shown in Figure 10. This plot of the visibility function clearly indicates that CMB\nphotons were not last scattered at a single redshift, but rather over a range of redshifts. The\nmaximum of the visibility function occurs at a redshift of z = 1090, which we identify as\n18\nthe redshift of decoupling. It has half maxima lying at redshifts of z = 1178 and z = 983,\ncorresponding to a redshift interval of \u2206z = 195. For the benchmark cosmology, the redshift\nof the maximum of the visibility function correspondeds to an age of the universe of t =\n370,000 years after the Big Bang, and most of the photons were last scattered between the\nepochs t= 320,000 and t= 440,000 years.\nAlthough the last scattering surface is not strictly speaking a surface, but rather a volume\nwith a \ufb01nite thickeness, it is nevertheless su\ufb03ciently thin that we can imagine it as acting\nlike a kind of photon barrier, similar to the photosphere of the Sun. No information carried\nby photons originating from z \u2273 1100 can reach the Earth, as the photons involved will be\nscattered many times.\nLet us work out the increment of comoving radial distance coordinate corresponding to\nthe thickness of the last scattering layer. At large redshifts, we can neglect the vaccum\nenergy relative to the matter density, and so an in\ufb01testimal interval of line-of-sight comoving\ndistance is\ndr= cdt\na = cdz\nH(z) \u2243cH\u22121\n0\ndz\nz3/2\u21261/2\nm0\n. (70)\nTaking the thickness of the last scattering layer to correspond to the redshift interval \u2206 z =\n1178 \u2212983 = 195 at z = 1090 as we computed above, the corresponding comoving radial\ndistance is\n\u2206r= 38 Mpc. (71)\nAlthough this is a distance along the line-of-sight, it is useful to calculate the angle on the\nsky it would project to, or equivalently the multipole \u2113\u22432\u03c0/\u03b8\n\u03b8= 9.5 arcmin; \u2113\u22432\u03c0\n\u03b8 = 2270. (72)\nOn comoving scales less than \u2206 r \u224340 Mpc, corresponding to angles smaller than about\n\u03b8 \u2272 10 arcmin or multipoles greater than \u2113 \u2273 1000, because of the \ufb01nite thickness of the\nlast-scattering layer, we expect the observed CMB to result from a number of independent\n\ufb02uctuations along the line-of-sight through the last scattering layer. Consequently, the ran-\ndom superposition of these perturbations leads to a statistical reduction in the amplitude\nof the observed intensity \ufb02uctuations by a factor of roughly N\u22121/2, where N is the number\nof \ufb02uctuations of a given size probed along the line of sight, i.e. N \u2243\u2206r/\u03bb. The power\nspectrum of the CMB will thus be suppressed on this scale. This suppression is essentially\njust geometric, i.e. it results from the fact that the CMB cannot be treated as a thin surface\nfor \ufb02uctuations comparable to the thickenss of the surface. This suppression of \ufb02uctuations\nfor \u2113\u2273 1000 can be seen in the CMB power spectrum in Fig. ??. There is in fact a second\nsource of suppression known as Silk Damping, due to the fact that photons can di\ufb00use out\nof overdensities via Thompson scattering. Analogous to free-streaming, small-scale \ufb02uctua-\ntions will be suppressed.\n19\n3 The Boltzmann Equation\nPredicting the power spectrum of CMB anisotropies is a challenging task. Because it involves\n\ufb02uctuations in the relativistic photon-baryon \ufb02uid on scales comparble to or in excess of the\nhorizon, GR is required. The full apparatus of perturbing the Einstein gravitational \ufb01eld\nequations yields equations that are analogous to the equations we derived when studying\nlinear structure formation in the Newtonian approximation. As we discussed previously when\ndiscussing transfer functions, additional complications arises because components like the\nphotons (at decoupling when the mean free-path becomes large), neutrinos, or dark matter\n(if there is signi\ufb01cant free-streaming) do not behave like a \ufb02uid and so the full Boltzmann\nequation must be solved. By considering the Boltzmann equation in GR, linearizing it, and\nthen taking moments to derive equations like the \ufb02uid equations, one obtains a set of coupled\ndi\ufb00erential equations for the Fourier mode amplitudes of the various quantities of interest:\n\u02d9\u0398 + ik\u00b5\u0398 = \u2212\u02d9\u03a6 \u2212ik\u00b5\u03a8 \u2212\u02d9\u03c4[\u00b5vb \u2212\u0398]\n\u02d9vb + \u02d9a\navb = \u2212ik\u03a8 + \u02d9\u03c4\nR[vb + 3i\u03981] . (73)\nHere \u0398 \u2261\u2206T/T is the Fourier transform of the perturbation to the photon distribution\nfunction, \u0398(x,\u02c6p,t), de\ufb01ned by\nf(x,p, \u02c6p,t) =\n[\nexp\n{ p\nT(t)[1 + \u0398(x,\u02c6p,t)]\n}\n\u22121\n]\u22121\n, (74)\nthus \u0398(x,\u02c6p,t) is the fractional temperature perturbation for photons propgating in a given\ndirection \u02c6p. The quantity \u00b5 is the cosine of the angle between the wavevector k and the\nphoton propagation direction \u02c6p, R= 3 \u03c1b/(4\u03c1r), and we have simpli\ufb01ed the equation by\nassuming that Thomson scattering is isotropic. The time derivatives here are with respect to\nthe conformal time de\ufb01ned byd\u03b7= dt/a(t). The quantities \u03a8 and \u03a6 are new, and result from\ntreating the situation in GR. Basically, two perturbations to the metric describe the e\ufb00ect\nof weak gravitational \ufb01elds resulting from the \ufb02uctuations for so-called scalar peturbations,\nwhere \u03a8 corresponds to what we usually think of as the Newtonian gravitational potential,\nand \u03a6 corresponds to a perturbation of the spatial curvature.\nIt is instructive to compare these equations to what we derived previously for Newtonian\nperturbation theory:\n\u2202\u03b4\n\u2202t + 1\na\u2207\u00b7\u03b4v = 0 (Continuity) (75)\n\u2202\u03b4v\n\u2202t + H\u03b4v = \u22121\na\u2207\u03b4\u03a6 \u2212c2\ns\na\u2207\u03b4 (Euler) (76)\n\u22072\u03b4\u03a6 = 4\u03c0Ga2\u03c10\u03b4 (Poisson). (77)\nAlthough the Boltzmann version looks complicated, every term has an immediately clear\nphysical interpretation. The left-hand side of the \ufb01rst equation for \u0398 is a convective de-\nrivtative, representing photon free streaming . We can think of this as the analog of the\n20\ncontinuity equation for the photons, but with source terms on the right-hand side. The \ufb01rst\ntwo terms on the right-hand side are the time dilation and gravitational redshift e\ufb00ects that\ngive rise to the Sachs-Wolfe e\ufb00ect, and describe the change in the energy of the photons as\nthey propagate through a perturbed spactime. The last term on the right-hand side repre-\nsents the redistribution of photons by Thomson scattering, which brings in the optical depth,\n\u03c4, and includes a Doppler boost from the velocity of the baryon \ufb02uid. The second equation\nis the force equation for the baryon velocity, which we knew as the Euler equation in the\nNewtonian analysis. It has the same form, except that it includes a second terms on the\nright-hand side to represent momentum tranfer to the baryons from the scattered photons.\nThis is quite nasty, as it involves \u0398 1, which is the dipole moment of the temperature \ufb01eld\n\u0398 \u2261\u2206T/T. So we have\n\u02d9\u0398 + ik\u00b5\u0398\ued19 \ued18\ued17 \ued1a\nconvective derivative\n= \u2212\u02d9\u03a6 \u2212ik\u00b5\u03a8\ued19 \ued18\ued17 \ued1a\nSW e\ufb00ect\n\u2212 \u02d9\u03c4[\u00b5vb \u2212\u0398]\ued19 \ued18\ued17 \ued1a\nThomson scattering\n\u02d9vb + \u02d9a\navb\n\ued19 \ued18\ued17 \ued1a\naccel. & Hubble drag\n= \u2212ik\u03a8\ued19\ued18\ued17\ued1a\npotential gradient\n+ \u02d9\u03c4\nR[vb + 3i\u03981]\n\ued19 \ued18\ued17 \ued1a\ngeneralized pressure\n. (78)\nThe natural approach to solving these equations is to start in Fourier space and consider\na density \ufb02uctuation of a given wavevector k. If we can work out how this appears as an\ninduced temperature \ufb02uctuation on the CMB sky then, becuase the equations above are\nlinear, the problem can be solved by the principle of superposition. The wavevector k sets\na natural polar axis, and the temperature anisotropy corresponds to knowing the photon\nphase-space distribution at our location in space, that is, the distribution of the photons in\nenergy and as a function of angle with respect tok. Evolving this function is hard principally\nbecause of the coupling between radiation and matter set by Thomson scattering. Scattering\na beam of photons that come from a given direction will tend to push the electron in the\nopposite direction, so a net force requires an anisotropic photon distribution. In fact, it is\nclear that the force must be proportional to the dipole monent of the distribution function\nwhich is the origin of the \u0398 1 in the equation above. This creates an obvious problem: it\ncouples the evolution of the number of photons traveling in a given direction\u02c6p with knowledge\nof the whole distribution. Mathematically, we have an integro-di\ufb00erential equation.\nIn practice, rather than trying to numerically solve for the photon distribution function\n(normally denoted by \u0398), we can carry out a multipole transform to work with \u0398 \u2113. The\nintegro-di\ufb00erential equation then becomes a set of equations that couple di\ufb00erent \u2113 values.\nThese have to be solved as a large set of equations (since the CMB power spectrum contains\nsignal extending beyond \u2113\u2273 1000), and when this is done we will have to integrate over k-\nspace. It took many years to solve this numerical challenge, and even then the computations\nwere very slow. A key development in cosmology was the development of CMBFAST in\n1996 by Seljak and Zaldarriaga, who \ufb01gured out a trick to perform the required Boltzmann\nequation integrations much faster than was previously possible. Their public release of this\ncode allowed computation of the CMB angular power spectrum su\ufb03ciently rapidly that a\nlarge range of models could be investigated by non-specialists. We discussed these Boltzmann\nsolvers previously when we discussed transfer functions in linear structure formation. There\n21\nare now other codes that supercede CMBFAST in accuracy and ease of use like CMBEASY,\nCAMB, CLASS, and PyCosmo.\n22\n48 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN FEBRUARY 2004\nBRYAN CHRISTIE DESIGN\nCOSMIC HARMONICS\nTHE SOUND SPECTRUM of the early universe had overtones much\nlike a musical instrument\u2019s. If you blow into a pipe, the sound\ncorresponds to a wave with maximum air compression (blue) at\nthe mouthpiece and maximum rarefaction (red) at the end\npiece. But the sound also has a series of overtones with shorter\nwavelengths that are integer fractions of the fundamental\nwavelength. (The wavelengths of the first, second and third\novertones are one half, one third and one fourth as long.)\nSOUND WAVES also oscillated in the plasma of the early\nuniverse. After inflation, the fundamental wave compressed\nsome regions of plasma and rarefied others, causing the\ntemperature of the CMB radiation in the regions to reach\nmaximum (blue) and minimum (red) values by the time of\nrecombination.

By 1929 he had obtained Cepheid distances for 24 galaxies with red-\nshifts and claimed that these displayed a linear relationship:v = Hd. He cited theoretical\npredictions from relativistic cosmology that redshift or velocity should increase linearly with\ndistance in an expanding Universe as a possible explanation. At the time, Hubble estimated\nH ' 500 km s\u00001 Mpc\u00001, because his calibration of Cepheid luminosities was in error. The\nbest modern value is close to 70 km s\u00001 Mpc\u00001.I n t h i s a n d t h e f o l l o w i n g f e w l e c t u r e s w e w i l l\nwork out the mathematical description of expanding spacetime that leads to Hubbble\u2019s law.\n1 Hubble Expansion and Scale Factora(t)\nFigure 1: Expansion of the Universe. The comoving distance between points on an imag-\ninary coordinate grid remains constant as the universe expands. The physical distance is\nproportional to the comoving distance times the scale factora(t)a n dh e n c ei n c r e a s e sw i t h\ntime. Figure from Baumann.\nNow we begin to mathematically codify the idea of an expanding Universe. Consider a\ndistribution of galaxies that is made to expand uniformly, in the same way as if a picture of\nthe pattern was undergoing continuous magni\ufb01cation as illustrated in Fig. 1. Mathematically,\nthis means that all position vectors at timet are just scaled versions of their values at a\nreference time t0:\nx(t)= a(t)x(t0). (1)\nDi\u21b5erentiating this with respect tot gives\n\u02d9x(t)=\u02d9a(t)x(t0)=[ \u02d9a(t)/a(t)]x(t), (2)\nor a velocity proportional to distance, as required. Writing this relation for two points 1 and\n2a n ds u b t r a c t i n g ,s h o w st h a tt h i se x p a n s i o na p p e a r st h es a m ef o ra n yc h o i c eo fo r i g i n\u2014\n1\neveryone is the center of the universe:\n[\u02d9x2(t) \u0000 \u02d9x1(t)] =H(t)[x2(t) \u0000 x1(t)]; H(t) \u2318 \u02d9a/a.

To describe the Universe as a whole we make no attempts to incorporate discrete\nstructures like galaxies or clusters. We imagine all matter in the Universe smeared out into\nan idealized, smooth \ufb02uid that de\ufb01nes the overall kinematics of the system of galaxies.\nThe mathematical framework for the standard model is based on theCosmological Princi-\nple,w h i c hi st h eh y p o t h e s i st h a t ,o ns u \u0000 c i e n t l yl a r g es c a l e s1 the Universe can be considered\nspatially homogeneous and isotropic. Philosophically this can be thought of as a generaliza-\ntion of the Copernican Principle,t h a tt h e r ei sn o t h i n gs p e c i a lo rp r i v e l e g e da b o u to u r\nplace in the universe. The cosmological principle can also be stated as the existence of a\nfundamental observer at each location, to whom the Universe appears isotropic. The\nconcept of a fundamental observer is required because two observers at the same point, but\nin relative motion, cannot both see the surrounding Universe as isotropic. The fundamental\nobserver thus implies a cosmological \u2018rest frame\u2019 at each location in space and this rest frame\nis de\ufb01ned to be one that is comoving with the Universe\u2019s gloabl expansion, or being \u201cin the\nHubble \ufb02ow\u201d.\nMore speci\ufb01cally, imagine the expanding universe \ufb01lled with fundamental observers each at\ndi\u21b5erent locations, all of whom are at rest with respect to the matter in their vicinity. We\ncan envisage them as each sitting on a di\u21b5erent galaxy, and so receding from each other\nwith the general Hubble expansion. Actually this is not quite right, since each galaxy has\na peculiar velocity with respect to its neighbors of a few hundred km s\u00001 which are sourced\nby density \ufb02uctuations. We really need to imagine an idealized universe where the matter\ndensity is uniform. The fundamental observers give us a way of de\ufb01ning a universal time\ncoordinate, even though relativity tells us that such a thing is impossible in general. We can\nde\ufb01ne a cosmological timet, which is the time measured by the clocks of these observers \u2013\ni.e. t is the proper time measured by an observer at rest with respect to the local matter\ndistribution and hence comoving with the expansion of the Universe.\nAn i c ec o n c r e t ee x a m p l eo ft h i si d e ao faf u n d a m e n t a lo b s e r v e ra tw o r ko c c u r si na n a l y s i s\nof the CMB.

At every point in spacetime there is ametric \u2013ag e o m e t r y\u2013t h a ti sd e t e r m i n e d\nby the gravitational \ufb01eld at that point. Given a geometry, we can calculate the equations of\nmotion. It was shown in 1935 by Robertson & Walker that the assumption of homogeneity\nand isotropy requires the metric to take the form, in spherical polar coordinates,\nds2 = \u0000c2dt2 + a2(t)\n\u21e5\ndr2 + S2\nk (r)(d\u27132 +s i n2 \u2713d\u00002)\n\u21e4\n= \u0000c2dt2 + a2(t)\n\u21e5\ndr2 + S2\nk (r)d\u23262\u21e4\n, (4)\nwhere\nSk(r)=\n8\n<\n:\nR0 sin(r/R0) k =+ 1\nrk =0\nR0 sinh(r/R0) k = \u00001\n(5)\nThis is known as the Robertson-Walker (RW) metric (or the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\nmetric). Here a(t)i st h escale factorintroduced in\u00a7 1w h i c hd e t e r m i n e st h eo v e r a l ls c a l eo f\nthe spatial part of the metric and thus describes how distances expand or contract with time.\nThe quantity k =+ 1 ,0 ,o r\u00001i st h ecurvature constant,a n dd\u23262 = d\u27132 +s i n2 \u2713d\u00002 is\nthe familiar solid angle from spherical coordinates, andr is a time\u2013independent (comoving)\nradial coordinate ! comoving observers have the samer at all times, even if the Universe\nexpands or contracts. The quantityR0 is the radius of curvatureof the universe at the\npresent epoch.\nThe quantityds2 is an invariant interval between two neighboring events in spacetime sep-\narated by dx\u00b5,( \u00b5 =0 , 1, 2, 3). In the language of GR this interval ds2 can be written\nas\nds2 =\nX\n\u00b5\u232b\ng\u00b5\u232bdx\u00b5dx\u232b, (6)\nwhere g\u00b5\u232b is themetric tensor(a symmetricN \u21e5N matrix, whereN =4i st h ed i m e n s i o n\nof the spacetime), which expresses the notion of distance between spacetime points. The\nmetric determines the trajectories of free-falling bodies (they move along geodesics of the\nspacetime) and also how light propagates in curved space (light travels along so-called null\ngeodesics) with ds2 =0 . T h ei n d i c e s\u00b5 and \u232b run over the time coordinate (labelled \u201c0\u201d)\nand the 3 space coordinates. In general,g\u00b5\u232b will be a complicated function of space and time\nwith o\u21b5-diagonal terms that make the separation of space and time impossible. However,\nthe metric tensor simpli\ufb01es enormously when space is homogeneous and isotropic.\nFinally, note that the coordinate system used above is not the only possibility. For example\nif we peform a change of varaibles\u21e2 = Sk(r), the metric for a homogenous, isotropic, three-\ndimensional space can be written\nds2 = \u0000c2dt2 + a2(t)\n\uf8ff d\u21e22\n1 \u0000 k(\u21e2/R0)2 + \u21e22d\u23262\n\u0000\n. (7)\n3\nwhich has the advantage that the\u21e22d\u23262 terms looks like what one gets in spherical coordi-\nnates for Euclidean (i.e. \ufb02at) space.\n2.3 Building Intuition For Metrics\nWhether we use the term or not, we are all familiar with metrics. For example, using the\nPythagorean theorem we can write the distance between two points in ordinary 3D space as\ns2 = x2 + y2 + z2, (8)\nwhich de\ufb01nes the so\u2013called Euclidean metric. In the special theory of relativity this becomes\ngeneralized to the distance between two spacetime points:\ns2 = \u0000(ct)2 + x2 + y2 + z2. (9)\nWe can write the in\ufb01nitesimal version of this as\nds2 =\nX\n\u00b5\u232b\n\u2318\u00b5\u232bdx\u00b5dx\u232b, (10)\nwhere the only nonzero components of the metric tensor are the diagonal terms (\u00001, 1, 1, 1)\n(Minkowski spacetime), and where it is understood thatdx0 = cdt.I f t h e t w o e v e n t s a r e\nconnected by a signal travelling atv,s u c ht h a tdxi = vidt then\nds2 = \u0000c2dt2\n\u2713\n1 \u0000 v2\nc2\n\u25c6\n. (11)\nAl i g h tp u l s ee x p a n d si nas p h e r ea tt h es p e e do fl i g h t ,s ov = c and thus it travels along a\nnull geodesicwith ds2 = 0, such that the events can be connected by a light-ray.\nIn spherical coordinates\nx = r sin \u2713 cos \u0000\ny = r sin \u2713 sin \u0000\nz = r cos \u2713, (12)\nwhere r is the radial coordinate,\u2713 is the polar angle, and\u0000 is the azimuthal angle\nds2 = \u0000c2dt2 + dr2 + r2(d\u27132 +s i n2 \u2713d\u00002). (13)\nThus the coordinate system changed but the metric still describes \ufb02at space.\nIn contrast, consider the surface of a 2D sphere of radiusR embedded in a \ufb02at 3D space.\nThe spatial part of the metric would then be\nds2 = R2(d\u27132 +s i n2 \u2713d\u00002). (14)\nIt is easy to show that this represents a closed surface with \ufb01nite area and no boundary. We\n4\n\u02c7\nFigure 2: Examples of di\u21b5erent spacetime ge-\nometries described by the FRW metric. In\nwhite is an equilateral triangle.

If the Universe has negative curva-\nture, then its geometry is the 3D analogue of\nan in\ufb01nite saddle.\ncan introduce a new radial coordinater = R sin \u2713,t h e n\ndr\nR =c o s\u2713d\u2713 =\n\uf8ff\n1 \u0000\n\u21e3 r\nR\n\u23182\u00001/2\nd\u2713, (15)\nand the line element in eqn. (14) can be rewritten as\nds2 = dr2\n1 \u0000 (r/R)2 + r2d\u00002. (16)\nNow note that this metric has the exact same form as the spatial part of the Robertson\u2013\nWalker metric in eqn. (7) (modulo the scale factora2), provided that we identifyd\u00002 = d\u23262,\ntake k =+ 1 ,a n di d e n t i f yR,t h er a d i u so fo u rs p h e r e ,w i t ht h er a d i u so fc u r v a t u r eR0\ndiscussed previously. Whereas the equation above is for a 2D spherical surface (which we\ncan visualize as being embedded in 3-space), eqn. (4) actually corresponds to a 3D spherical\nvolume which, just like the 2D sphere, is spatially closed and has a \ufb01nite volume.\nIt is possible to convert this to the metric for the 2D analog of a constant negative curvature\nsurface by considering an imaginary radius of curvatureR ! iR.I n t h i s c a s ek = \u00001a n d\nthe metric takes the form\nds2 = dr2\n1+( r/R)2 + r2d\u00002. (17)\n5\nHilbert proved that a two-dimensional surface of uniform negative curvature cannot be em-\nbedded in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, so this is not something you can easily\nvisualize. Maybe that is not so surprising, since the hyperbolic space described by this\nmetric has in\ufb01nite area.\nThe saddle shape illustrated in Fig 2 has uniform negative curvature only in the central\nregion, near the \u201cseat\u201d of the saddle.\nFinally, the Euclidean case of zero curvature is the casek =0w h i c hy o uc a nt h i n ko fa s\nthe limit where the radius of curvatureR !1 . As we will see observations indicate that\nk = 0 to very high precision, so for the purposes of this course we will work primarily with\nthe Euclidean case.\n3 Proper Distance, Redshift, and Hubble Drag\n3.1 Proper Distance\nConsider a galaxy su\u0000ciently far away from us that that we can consider the Universe as\nuniform on this scale and thus well described by the RW metric. In an expanding universe,\nthe distance between two objects is increasing with time as illustrated by the simple example\nin \u00a7 1. The proper distance rp between two points is equal to the length of the spacelike\ngeodesic (a geodesic withdt = 0) between them at some instant in cosmic timet,s u c ht h a t\nwe can considerdt =0a n dt h es c a l ef a c t o rt ob e\ufb01 x e da tt h ev a l u ea(t), which implies\nds2 = a2(t)dr2 =) ds = a(t)dr (18)\nwhere we have assumed the angle (\u2713, \u0000)i se q u a lt oac o n s t a n ta l o n gt h i sg e o d e s i cs u c ht h a t\nd\u23262 =0 .\nThe proper distancerp is obtained by integrating over the radial comoving coordinater:\nrp(t)= a(t)\nZ r\n0\ndr = a(t)r. (19)\nThus the proper distancerp(t)i saf u n c t i o no ft i m eb u tt h ec o m o v i n gd i s t a n c er is not. The\nrate of change of proper distance between any two points is\nvp(t)= \u02d9rp(t)=\u02d9a(t)r = \u02d9a\narp = H(t)rp, (20)\nwhere we have used the time dependent Hubble expanstion rateH(t)=\u02d9a/a.T h e e q u a t i o n\nabove implies that at any timet there is a linear relation between the proper distance to\nag a l a x ya n di t sr e c e s s i o ns p e e dw h i c hi sr e f e r r e dt oa st h eHubble \ufb02ow. At the present\ntime t = t0 we de\ufb01ne H(t0) \u2318 H0, which has the observationally determined value of\n68 \u00b1 2k ms\u00001 Mpc\u00001. Again this idea of a constant comoving distancer,t h es c a l ef a c t o r\na(t), and the resulting linear relation between velocityvp and proper distance rp are just\nrepetitions of the discussion in\u00a7 1o ft h ee x p a n d i n gp i c t u r ep a t t e r n ,b u tn o we x p r e s s e dm o r e\nformally in terms of the metric.\n6\n3.2 Light Propagation and Redshift\nTo analyse the observations of light from distant ob jects we need to account for the fact that\nthe wavelength of the light gets stretched (or, equivalently, the photons lose energy) due to\nthe expansion of the universe, which is known asredshift.W e c a n w o r k o u t h o w r e d s h i f t\nrelates to a(t). Let us consider the time it takes light to travel along a null geodesic with\nds2 =0 .

(22)\nSince r is a comoving coordinate which by construction has not changed with time, both\neqn. (21) and eqn. (22) are equal tor. This implies that\n\u0000tobs = a(tobs)\na(tem) \u0000tem.\nNow imagine that the time interval we considered \u0000tem to be at di\u21b5erent crests of an electro-\nmagnetic wave so that \u0000tem can be identi\ufb01ed with the periodTem =1 /\u232bem = \u0000em/c.W e c a n\nalso choose tobs to be the present day so that the scale factora(tobs)=1 ,w h i c hi sh o ww e\ngenerally normalize the scale factor at the present epoch. The previous equation can then\nbe rewritten as\n\u0000obs = a(tem)\u00001\u0000em =( 1+ z)\u0000em (23)\nwhere we have de\ufb01neda(tem) \u2318 1/(1 +z). The expansion of the Universe implies light must\nredshift!\n3.3 Peculiar Velocity and Hubble Drag\nAs we will see later, small perturbations in the background energy density distribution cause\nthe growth of structures, which in turn induce velocities that deviate from pure expansion.\nThese velocities with respect to the cosmological rest frame of the fundamental observers\nare called peculiar velocities.\n7\nznnnnnnnnnrn vvvennnn n\nunnr\nrredshiftiz.no\nblueshift Zeo\nThe proper velocity with respect to a fundamental observer at the origin isvp = drp/dt,\nwhere\nvp = drp\ndt = d\ndt(a(t)r(t)) = \u02d9a(t)r(t)+ a(t)\u02d9r(t)= vexp + vpec (24)\nwhere we have used eqn. (19) forrp and the comoving distancer(t) is now a function of\ntime beacuse of the presence of a peculiar velocity, such that\u02d9r(t)i st h ec o m o v i n gp e c u l i a r\nvelocity anda(t)\u02d9r(t)c o n v e r t st h i st oap r o p e rp e c u l i a rv e l o c i t yvpec.\nXtime = t\n!observer\nVpec(t) Xtime = t + dt\n!d\u2113 Vpec(t+dt)\nFigure 3: A particleX with peculiar velocityvpec observed by an observerO at two di\u21b5erent\ntimes, t and t = t + dt.\nNow imagine that there is a particle which is moving with a proper peculiar velocityvpec.\nIt will gradually overtake objects as it moves, but since in an expanding universe objects\nfarther away from it are moving faster, its velocity will decelerate relative to fundamental\nobservers comoving with the local Hubble \ufb02ow.\nTo be more precise consider the diagram in Fig. 3. A fundamental observerO observes a\nparticle X traveling with peculiar velocityvpec(t). An in\ufb01tesimal interval dt of time later\nat timet + dt the particle X has traveled to a new locationd` away fromO and has a new\npeculiar velocity vpec(t + dt). The quesiton we aim to answer is how doesvpec(t)c h a n g e\nwith time?\nTo answer this consider that from the perspective ofO,t h ep a r t i c l eP has no forces acting on\nit, and because special relativity applies over these in\ufb01testimal intervals we are considering,\nP cannot have been accelerated, and since the proper velocities are physical velocities we\nmust havevp(t)= vp(t + dt)w h e r evp is the proper velocity measured byO.\nAt timet\nvp(t)= vpec(t), (25)\nsince there is no expansion contribution sinceO is a fundamental observer moving with the\nHubble \ufb02ow andr(t)=0( t h ec o m o v i n gs e p a r a t i o nb e t w e e nt h ep a r t i c l eX and O)a tt =0 .\n8\nWhereas at timet + dt\nvp(t+dt)= vexp(t+dt)+vpec(t+dt)= H(t+dt)d`+vpec(t+dt) \u21e1 H(t)vpec(t)dt+vpec(t+dt).\n(26)\nHere we have written the expansion term in terms of the Hubble constant, and in the last\napproximation we have usedd` = vpec(t)dt and Taylor expanded working only to linear\norder in small quantities. Equatingvp(t)= vp(t + dt), we \ufb01nd\nvpec(t + dt) \u0000 vpec = \u0000H(t)vpec(t)dt (27)\nor dvpec\ndt = \u0000Hvpec. (28)\nThus we see that from the perspective ofO,t h epeculiar velocity of particleX decreases\nwith time, which is known asHubble drag.\nWe can rearrange this equation slightly to obtain\ndvpec\ndt = dvpec\nda \u02d9a = \u0000 \u02d9a\navpec ! dvpec\nda = \u00001\navpec. (29)\nTaking the dot product of the equation above withvvec one obtains\ndvpec\nda \u00b7 vpec = 1\n2\ndv2\npec\nda = \u00001\nav2\npec ! dv2\npec\nv2\npec\n= \u00002da\na (30)\nIt is easy to show that this implies\nln(vpec/vpec,0)= \u0000ln(a/a0)( 3 1 )\nor\nvpec / a\u00001. (32)\nOne can also show that the relativistic generalization of this is thatp / a\u00001 where p is the\nmomentum. For a particle moving atv = c,w ea l r e a d yd e r i v e dt h i s . . . i t \u2019 sc a l l e dr e d s h i f t !\nIn other words, since photon momentum depends on wavelength, the redshifting of light\namounts to the samep / a\u00001 reduction in momentum. Whereas our prevous deriviation of\nthe redshift treated light as an electromagnetic wave with crests and troughs, this derivation\nin terms of momentum also applies to the quantum mechanical treatment of light as photons.\n4 Horizons\nThe size of a causally connected patch of space is determined by how far light can travel\nin a certain amount of time. As we mentioned previously in\u00a7 3.2, light travels along null\ngeodesics with ds2 = 0 and we have from the FRW metric\ncdt\na(t) = dr, (33)\n9\n\u2f06\nnull geodesics\nwhere t is cosmic time,r is the comoving distance, and we orient our coordinate system to\nhave d\u23262 =0 .

(34)\nIntegrating both sides, we see that along a null geodesic one then has\n\u0000r = \u00b1c\u0000\u2327, (35)\nwhere the plus sign corresponds to outgoing photons and the minus sign to incoming photons.\nThe advantage of the conformal time is that in these coordinates the propagation of light in\nthe FRW metric looks the same as it does in Minkowski spacec\u0000t =\u0000 x,n a m e l yl i g h tr a y s\ntravel along straight lines at 45\u0000 angles inr \u0000\u2327 coordinates (assumingc =1a si sc u s t o m a r y\nin relativity), whereas had we used the cosmic timet the light cones in a curved spacetime\nwould be curved.\nWe are now in a position to de\ufb01ne two di\u21b5erent types of cosmological horizons. One which\nlimits the distances at which past events can be observed and another which limits the\ndistances at which it will ever be possible to in\ufb02uence events in the future. Because signals\ncannot travel faster than the speed of light, these horizons then also determine the sizes of\ncausally connected regions of spacetime.\n4.1 Particle Horizon\nAccording to eqn. (35), the maximum comoving distance that light can travel between two\nconformal times \u23271 and \u23272 >\u2327 1 is simply \u0000r = c\u0000\u2327. Hence if the Big Bang \u2018started\u2019 with a\nsingularity at ti \u2318 0, then the largest comoving distance from which an observer at timet\nwill be able to receive a signal traveling at the speed of light is given by\nrph(\u2327)= c(\u2327 \u0000 \u2327i)=\nZ t\nti\ncdt\na(t), (36)\nwhich is known as thecomoving particle horizon.T h e s i z e o f t h e p a r t i c l e h o r i z o n a t\ntime \u2327 can be visualised by the intersection of the past light cone of an observerp with the\nspacelike hypersurface (i.e. constant time) \u2327 = \u2327i, which corresponds to the Big Bang as\nillustrated in Figure 4. Notice that the Big Bang singularity is a moment in time, butnot\nap o i n ti ns p a c e ,w h i c he x p l a i n sw h yw ei l l u s t r a t et h es i n g u l a r i t yb ya ne x t e n d e d( p o s s i b l y\nin\ufb01nite) spacelike hypersurface in Figure 4.

Notice that every observer has his or her own particle horizon.\n4.2 Event Horizon\nJust as there are past events that we cannot see now, there may be regions of space in the\nfuture that we will never be able to in\ufb02uence. In comoving coordinates, the largest distance\nfrom which an observer at some future timetf will receive signals emitted at any time later\n10\nthan an earlier timet is given by\nreh(\u2327)= c(\u2327f \u0000 \u2327)=\nZ tf\nt\ncdt\na(t), (37)\nwhich is called the comoving event horizon. It is conceptually similar to the event horizon\nof black holes in that it de\ufb01nes a maximum distance out to which a signal can ever travel.\nHere, \u2327f denotes the \u2018\ufb01nal moment of conformal time\u2019. Notice that\u2327f may be \ufb01nite even if\nthe \ufb01nal moment of physical time is in\ufb01nitetf =+ 1.I n d e e d , w h e t h e r o r n o t t h i s i s t h e\ncase depends on the form ofa(t). In particular,\u2327f is \ufb01nite for our universe if dark energy is\nreally a cosomological constant.\nFigure 4: Spacetime diagram illustrating the concept of horizons. Dotted lines show the\nworldlines of comoving objects. The particle horizon is the maximal distance from which we\ncan receive signals. Thus the shaded region indicates regions of spacetime that are causally\nconnected to us. The event horizon is the maximal distance to which we can send a signal.\nThe speed of light is assumed to be unity in this diagram such that light travels along world\nlines oriented at a 45\u0000 angle.\n11\nto\nFigure 5: Light cone inx, y, t-space.

Einstein\u2019s \ufb01eld equation plays a role in\ngeneral relativity that is analogous to Poisson\u2019s equation in Newtonian dynamics. Poisson\u2019s\nequation,\nr2\u0000=4 \u21e1G\u21e2, (1)\ntells you how to compute the gravitational potential \u0000 given the mass density\u21e2. Analogously,\nEinstein\u2019s \ufb01eld equation is\nG\u00b5\u232b = 8\u21e1G\nc4 T\u00b5\u232b, (2)\nwhere G\u00b5\u232b is the Einstein tensor,w h i c hi sa4\u21e5 4s y m m e t r i ct e n s o rw h i c hd e p e n d so n\nderivatives of the metricg\u00b5\u232b,a n dT\u00b5\u232b is thestress-energy tensor, sometimes also called the\nenergy-momentum tensor, which quanti\ufb01es the density of energy and momentum and how\nthey \ufb02ow. The tensors are symmetric, so the result is ten nonlinear second-order di\u21b5erential\nequations. Given the stress energy tensor, one can solve the \ufb01eld equation for the metricg\u00b5\u232b\ndetermining how mass-energy tells space how to curve. Armed with the metric one can then\ndetermine particle trajectories via thegeodesic equation, which depends on derivatives\nof the metric. Spacetime thus tells mass-energy how to move, and the geodesic equation is\nthe analog of taking the gradient of the gravitational potential to determine the Newtonian\nforce on a particle.\nSolutions to the Einsten \ufb01eld equation can be extremely complicated. However, in the\ncosmological context the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy dramatically simplify the\nproblem. Recall the RW metric\nds2 = \u0000c2dt2 + a2(t)\n\u21e5\ndr2 + Sk(r)d\u23262\u21e4\n, (3)\nwhere\nSk(r)=\n8\n<\n:\nR0 sin(r/R0) k =+ 1\nrk =0\nR0 sinh(r/R0) k = \u00001.\n(4)\nSo for our present purposes, we need to understand how the energy denstiy\u21e2 and pressure\nP of the material in the universe determine the scale factora(t), the curvature constantk,\nand R0 the radius of curvature at the present epoch.\n1 The Friedmann Equation\nThe equation of motion for the scale factora(t)k n o w na st h eF r i e d m a n ne q u a t i o nc a nb e\nderived in a quasi-Newtonian fashion. The cosmological principle states that the the Universe\nis homogeneous and isotropic when aveaged over su\u0000ciently large scales. It thus follows that\nits global properties (such as density and pressure) at any time must be the same as those in\n1\nsome volume su\u0000ciently small1 that Newtonian physics is valid (but su\u0000ciently large that\nhomogeneity and isotropy still hold). Consider such a small spherical region of \ufb01xed mass\nM enclosed within radiusR. Homogeneity and isotropy imply that the acceleration of a test\nparticle at R should obey\n\u00a8R = \u0000GM\nR2 , (5)\nNote that, because of the homogeneity, there is no force due to pressure gradients and that\nonly the mass within the sphere is relevant for the dynamics ofR.T h i s f o l l o w s d i r e c t l y\nfrom Birkho\u21b5\u2019s theorem, according to which the gravitational acceleration at any radius in\na spherically symmetric system depends only on the mass within that radius.\nWe can multiply each side of this equation by\u02d9R and integrate once to obtain\n1\n2\n\u02d9R2 \u0000 GM\nR = E. (6)\nHere E is a constant of integration which equals the energy per unit mass of a test particle at\nR. Now using the fact that the mass of the sphere is a constant equal toM =4 \u21e1\u21e2(t)R(t)3/3,\nwhere \u21e2(t)i st h em a s sd e n s i t y ,w ec a nr e w r i t et h ee q u a t i o na b o v ea s\n1\n2\n\u02d9R2 \u0000 4\u21e1G\u21e2R2\n3 = E, (7)\nIf we now de\ufb01neR = a(t)R0,w h e r eR0 is independent oft,i tt h e nf o l l o w s\nH2(t)=\n\u2713 \u02d9a\na\n\u25c62\n= 8\u21e1G\u21e2\n3 \u0000 kc2\nR2\n0a2 , (8)\nwhere wave have introduced a new integration constant,k = \u00002E/c2,t ob ei d e n t i \ufb01 e dw i t h\nthe curvature constant in the RW metric in eqn. (4).\nThe equation above is known as theFriedmann equationand is one of the two fundamental\nequations describing the expansion of the universe. Although we derived it classically, its\nform is identical to the equation resulting from the proper treatment of GR. There are\nhowever two important di\u21b5erences that only a full relativistic treatment can elucidate.\nFirst, the fully relativistic version of eqn. (5) for the acceleration from which we derived the\nFriedmann equation is\n\u00a8R = \u00004\u21e1G\n3 R\n\u2713\n\u21e2 + 3P\nc2\n\u25c6\n, (9)\nwhich encodes the fact that in GR pressure gravitates and the active energy density that\nsources gravity is now\u21e2 +3 P/c2.T h i s e q u a t i o n f o r t h e a c c e l e r a t i o n a n d t h e F r i e d m a n n\nequation (eqn. 8) in fact arise as independent equations from di\u21b5erent components of the\nEinstein equation. The Friedmann equation turns out to be identical to our classical result\nprovided that \u21e2 is taken as the energy density of anything, i.e. mass energy, radiation,\n1By small here we mean relative to the Hubble radiuscH\u00001\n0 and if the universe is curvedk 6= 0 then also\nto the radius of curvatureR0 \u21e0 cH\u00001\n0 .\n2\ni\no\ntruer very\nor vacuum energy (note that following convention, we write\u21e2 as a mass density which is\ne\u21b5ectively the energy density divided byc2). But this dependence on pressure implies that\none needs one more piece of information in order to solve for the universe\u2019s dynamics, namely\nthe equation of state of each energy componentP(\u21e2)w h i c hw ew i l lc o m et on e x t .\nThe second di\u21b5erence between the classical treatment and GR is that classically the energy\nE and radius R0 of this shell are arbitrary initial conditions att = 0. Whereas in the full\nderivation from GR the curvature constantk is uniquely determined to bek =+ 1 ,\u00001, or 0\nand R0 is the radius of curvature of the universe (ifk 6= 0), both of which are determined by\nthe mass energy contents of the universe. This profound connection between the geometry\nof the universe and its energy contents cannot be fully captured classically.\nTo understand the physical implications of this relationship between geometry and mass-\nenergy it helps to de\ufb01ne the critical density\u21e2c and the density parameter \u2326(t)\n\u21e2c(t) \u2318 3H2(t)\n8\u21e1G and \u2326( t)= \u21e2\n\u21e2c\n(10)\nsuch that the Friedmann equation (eqn. (8)), can be written\n1 \u0000 \u2326(t)= \u0000 kc2\nR2\n0a2(t)H2(t) (11)\nwhich can be rearranged\nk =[ \u2326 (t) \u0000 1]\n\u2713 R0a2(t)\ncH\u00001(t)\n\u25c62\n. (12)\nIn this form, one more clearly sees how the curvature is related to the energy contents. There\nare three possibilities that can be distinguished provided one can measure the value of \u2326(t)\nat any time:\n\u2022 spatially open: if at any time \u2326(t) < 1t h e nt h i si m p l i e sk< 0a n dt h eu n i v e r s eh a s\nnegative curvature (hyperbolic geometry).\n\u2022 spatially closed: if at any time \u2326(t) > 1t h e nt h i si m p l i e sk> 0a n dt h eu n i v e r s e\nhas positive curvature (spherical geometry).\n\u2022 spatially \ufb02at: if at any time \u2326(t)=1t h e nt h i si m p l i e sk =0a n dt h eu n i v e r s ei s\ufb02 a t\nand the geometry is Euclidean.\nThe current best constraints on \u23260 =\u2326 (t = t0)c o m ef r o mt h ec o m b i n i n gt h eP l a n c k\nCMB measurements with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements.

Notice that the classical notion of energy conservation is expressed by\nthe continuity equation \u02d9\u21e2 = \u0000r \u00b7\u21e1,w h i c hs t a t e st h a tt h er a t eo fc h a n g eo fe n e r g yd e n s i t y\nequals the negative divergence of the energy \ufb02ux\u21e1. This can be derived via Noether\u2019s\ntheorem because of symmetry under time translations. However, this symmetry is broken\nin an expanding spacetime, so the standard notion of energy conservation does not have to\nhold and is replaced by eqn. (17).\nLet\u2019s now consider what happens when we combine these two key equations, i.e. the Fried-\nmann equation in eqn. (8) and the \ufb02uid equation above. Let\u2019s start with the Friedmann\n4\ni\nequation multiplied through bya2\n\u02d9a2 = 8\u21e1G\n3 \u21e2a2 \u0000 kc2\nR2\n0\n.

(21)\nwhich is the fully relativistic version of theacceleration equation (see eqn. 9), which as\nmentioned previously, indicates that pressure as well as energy are sources of gravitational\nacceleration.\n3 Equations of State and Energy Density Evolution\nTo recap, we have discussed three equations that describe the expansion of the universe:\nH2(t)= 8\u21e1G\u21e2\n3 \u0000 kc2\nR2\n0a2 Friedmann equation\n\u02d9\u21e2 +3 \u02d9a\na\n\u2713\n\u21e2 + P\nc2\n\u25c6\n=0 \ufb02 u i de q u a t i o n\n\u00a8a\na = \u00004\u21e1G\n3\n\u2713\n\u21e2 + 3P\nc2\n\u25c6\nacceleration equation. (22)\nOnly two of these are independent since we\u2019ve just seen that we can obtain the acceleration\nequation by combining the other two. These two independent equations however depend on\nthree unknown functionsa(t), \u21e2(t)a n dP(t), so we clearly need another equation to solve\nfor the evolution of the universe. Speci\ufb01cally, what we need is an equation of state, which\nis a relationship between the pressureP and energy density\u21e2, P(\u21e2), for whatever forms of\nenergy \ufb01ll the universe.\nIn principle there may be many di\u21b5erent sources contributing to the energy density of the\nUniverse: matter (both non-relativistic and relativistic), radiation, dark energy, scalar \ufb01elds,\netc. As we shall see later the Universe transited from a radiation dominated phase early on to\na matter dominated phase at later stages. In addition, the Universe has become dominated\nby dark energy in the recent past. We therefore focus on these three energy components and\n5\n6\nwrite the total energy density\n\u21e2c2 = \u21e2m(c2 + \u270f)| {z }\nmatter\n+\nradiation\nz }| {\n4\u0000SB\nc T4 + \u21e2de|{z}\ndark energy\n, (23)\nwhere the \u21e2m is the mass density,\u270f is the internal energy of the matter per unit mass (i.e.\n\u270f =3 kBTm/(2m)f o ram o n a t o m i ci d e a lg a s ,w h e r ekB is Boltzmann\u2019s constant, andTm is\nthe temperature of the matter),T is the radiation \ufb01eld temperature, and\u21e2de is the dark\nenergy density.\nThe pressure associated with any of these energy components is expressed according to an\nequation of state. Becuase cosmology only deals with dilute gases the equation of state\nalways takes a simple linear form\nP = w\u21e2c2, (24)\nwhere w is a dimensionless number. Plugging this form into the \ufb02uid equation above (see\neqn. 22)\n\u02d9\u21e2 +3 \u02d9a\na (\u21e2 + w\u21e2)=0 , (25)\nwhich can be rearranged to give\nd\u21e2\n\u21e2 = \u00003(1 +w)da\na . (26)\nProvided thatw is a constant we can integrate to obtain\n\u21e2 = \u21e20a\u00003(1+w), (27)\nwere \u21e20 is the energy density of some component of the energy density (i.e. matter, radiation,\ndark energy) at the present epoch (i.e.a0 =1 ) .

(28)\nNote that w 6= kBT/m since \u21e2m 6= \u21e2.T o d e t e r m i n ew it is useful to write the equation of\nstate of the ideal gas as a function of the adibatic index\u0000.R e c a l lt h a tf o ra ni d e a lg a s\nPm =( \u0000 \u0000 1)\u21e2m\u270f (29)\nwhere \u270f is the internal energy per unit mass. For example for a monatomic ideal gas\u0000 =5 /3,\n\u270f =3 kBT/(2m), and we recover the ideal gas law above for the pressure eqn. (28).\n6\nWe can make it explicit that (in the non-relativistic limit), the rest-mass energy does not\ncontribute to the gas pressure by noting that the total energy density\u21e2c2 = \u21e2m(c2 + \u270f)a n d\nrewriting the equation above as\nPm =( \u0000 \u0000 1)(\u21e2c2 \u0000 \u21e2mc2)( 3 0 )\nCombining eqns (28) and (30) we can write\nPm = kBT\nmc2\n\u2713\n1+ 1\n\u0000 \u0000 1\nkBT\nmc2\n\u25c6\u00001\n\u21e2c2, (31)\nwhich implies\nw(T)= kBT\nmc2\n\u2713\n1+ 1\n\u0000 \u0000 1\nkBT\nmc2\n\u25c6\u00001\n. (32)\nSince for a non-relativistic gaskBT \u2327 mc2, we immediately see thatw(T) \u2327 1. in other\nwords a non-relativistic gas is well approximated by a \ufb02uid with zero pressurew =0w h i c h\nis often referred to as adust \ufb02uid.\nSince \u21e2 / a\u00003(1+w) ad u s t\ufb02 u i dh a s\u21e2 / a\u00003 as expected. In other words, since the internal\nenergy is negligible compared to the mass-energy, it is only the dilution of the number\nof particles per proper volume that causes the mass-energy density to decrease with the\nUniverse\u2019s expansion. To understand how the Universe\u2019s expansion alters the temperature\nof this \ufb02uid we use kinetic theory which relates gas temperature to the random peculiar\nmotions of the gas particles kBT / mhv2i.W e l e a r n e d p r e v i o u s l y t h a t m o m e n t u m a n d\nvelocity redshift away asv / a\u00001,t h u sw eo b t a i nT / a\u00002.\n3.2 Radiation\nAt early times the energy density of the universe is dominated by contributions from a hot\nplasma comprised of relativistic particles and radiation in thermal equilibrium at temperature\nT. To determine the equation of state and scalings with redshift during this period we\napproximate the energy density as arising from an ultra-relativistic \ufb02uid of particles for\nwhich\nP = \u21e2c2\n3 =) w = 1\n3. (33)\nThis is just the familiar relationship between pressure and energy density for radiation,\nwhich an ultra-relativistic \ufb02uid must clearly approximate. It can be derived explicitly by\nwriting down the expressions forP and \u21e2 for Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics and\ncarrying out the phase-space integrals in the relativistic limit, which we will come to in a few\nlectures. We see then from eqn. (27) that for radiation\u21e2 / a\u00004.F o rab l a c kb o d yr a d i a t i o n\n\ufb01eld \u21e2 / T4 (see eqn. 23) which then implies thatT / a\u00001. Note the di\u21b5erence between\nthe temperature scaling for radiation and that that for a non-relativistic ideal gasTm / a\u00002\nthat we derived above.\nThis important result explains how the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation\nmaintains its blackbody form as the Universe expands. Prior to recombination the radiation\n7\n\u6d88\u6389Pm\ni\nis in thermal equilibrium with the matter due to the tight coupling provided by Thompson\nscattering o\u21b5 of electrons. This black body spectrum is frozen in after recombination when\nthe opacity vanishes and photons are released. The number of photons is then simply\nconserved (not true for a true black body), and the\u21e2 / a\u00004 results from the intuitive\nexplanation that the number of photons is a constant and the number density dilutes asa\u00003,\nbut the extra factor ofa arises from the redshifting away of photon energy caused as the\nUniverse expands, i.e.E = h\u232b,w i t h\u232b / a\u00001.W e w i l l d e r i v e t h i s r e s u l t m o r e f o r m a l l y u s i n g\nstatistical mechanics in a few lectures.\n3.3 Dark Energy\nIn classical physics there is no way for a vacuum to have energy. But quantum \ufb01eld theory\npermits particle-antiparticle pairs to spontaneously appear and then annihilate from the\nvacuum. Just as there is an energy density associated with real particles in the Universe,\nthere is an energy density\u21e2vac associated with the virtual particle-antiparticle pairs. One can\nthen argue that the vacuum energy density\u21e2vac is a quantum-mechanical phenomenon that\nonly depends on the energy di\u21b5erence between the true and false vacua and knows nothing\nabout the expansion of the Universe and thus\u21e2vac must be independent of time. It then\nfollows from the \ufb02uid equation (eqn. 22), that for vacuum energy since\n\u21e2 = \u21e20a\u00003(1+w) / const. =) P = \u0000\u21e2c2. (34)\nThis concept of negative pressure can be di\u0000cult to wrap your mind around. One way to\nbuild physical intuition is to recall the \ufb01rst law of thermodynamics (eqn. 14)\ndU + PdV =0 . (35)\nIf the vacuum is to have a positive energy density associated with it then expanding space\ncreates more vacuum and hence more energy. This requires that work be done\ndU + PdV =0 = ) \u21e2vacc2dV = \u0000PvacdV =) Pvac = \u0000\u21e2vacc2. (36)\nThis vacuum energy results inanti-gravity that causes the expansion of the Universe to\naccelerate. From the acceleration equation ifPvac = \u0000\u21e2vacc2\n\u00a8a\na = \u00004\u21e1G\n3\n\u2713\n\u21e2 + 3P\nc2\n\u25c6\n= 8\u21e1G\n3 \u21e2vac. (37)\nMore generally we can see that, assuming an equation of stateP = w\u21e2c2\n\u00a8a\na = \u00004\u21e1G\n3\n\u2713\n\u21e2 + 3P\nc2\n\u25c6\n= \u00004\u21e1G\n3 (1 + 3w)\u21e2. (38)\nThus ifw< \u00001/3 ! then \u00a8a> 0 and the expansion will accelerate. Any energy component\nthat satis\ufb01es this criteria for its equation of state is referred to asdark energy.\nTable 3.3 indicates how each of the mass energy components we have discussed scales with\n8\nredshift.\nTable 1: Scalings with Scale Factor of Dominant Mass-Energy Components.\nDominant components w\u21e2PT\nmatter 0 a\u00003 a\u00005 a\u00002\nradiation 1 /3 a\u00004 a\u00004 a\u00001\nvacuum energy \u00001 a0 a0\n4 The Friedmann Equation in terms of\u2326s\nUsing what we have learned about how di\u21b5erent forms of energy (matter, radiation, vacuum\nenergy) dilute with the expansion we can rewrite the Friedmann equation\nH2(t)=\n\u2713 \u02d9a\na\n\u25c62\n= 8\u21e1G\n3\n\u21e5\n\u21e2m,0a\u00003 + \u21e2r,0a\u00004 + \u21e2\u21e4,0\n\u21e4\n\u0000 kc2\nR0a2 , (39)\nwhere zero subscripts indicate the energy density in matter, radiation, and vacuum energy\nat the present epocht = t0 where the scale factora(t0)=1 .

(46)\n10\nfrom eqn1421\nPhys 236: Cosmology\nLecture 4: Model Universes and Distances Measures\nIn this lecture we will numerically evaluate the densities at the present time in matter,\nradiation, and dark energy, and then discuss solutions to the Friedmann equation in various\nlimiting cases. Once the expansion history is determined we can evaluate the distances and\ntime between two points, and we will see that there are many ways to do so in an expanding\nUniverse.\n1 Densities at Present\nPreviously we de\ufb01ned the density parameters of matter, radiation, and dark energy at the\npresent time relative to the critical density\n\u21e2c(t0)= 3H2\n0\n8\u21e1G =9 .2 \u21e5 10\u000030\n\u2713 h\n0.70\n\u25c62\ngc m\u00003 =1 .4 \u21e5 1011\n\u2713 h\n0.70\n\u25c62\nM\u0000 Mpc\u00003, (1)\nsuch that \u2326m,0 = \u21e2m,0/\u21e2c,0,e t c .

Well the numbers above suggest it is negligibly small, which it is\nat the present epoch. To be more precise, we will refer to this as the relativistic component to\naccount for the fact that it can include more than just photons. The relativistic component is\ndominated by the CMB which is, to high accuracy, a black body at temperatureT\u0000 =2 .73 K.\nA black body radiation \ufb01eld is described by the black body function, and it has an energy\ndensity\n\u21e2\u0000c2 = 4\u0000SBT4\nc ; \u0000SB = \u21e12k4\nB\n60~3c2 , (6)\n1\nwhere \u0000SB is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. We will explicitly derive the expression above\nlater from statistical mechanics when we discuss thermal history. Plugging in numbers, we\nobtain\n\u21e2\u0000,0 =4 .7 \u21e5 10\u000034 gc m\u00003 or \u2326\u0000,0 \u2318 5.1 \u21e5 10\u00005. (7)\nNote that the background radiation in starlight is about an order of magnitude lower than\nthat contributed by the CMB so it can be safely neglected.\nRecall that the CMB is a relic from the time when the Universe was hot and dense enough\nto be opaque (due to Thompson scattering) to photons. If we extrapolate further back, we\nreach a time when the Universe was hot and dense enough to be opaque toneutrinos. What\nthis means is that various interactions between neutrinos, leptons, and baryons kept the\nneutrinos tightly coupled to and in thermal equilibrium with the primordial radiation bath\nthat dominates the energy density of the Universe.\nThere is thus an equivalent background of relic cosmic neutrinos which we will treat as\n\u2018radiation\u2019, since the the neutrino mass is su\u0000ciently smallm\u232bc2 . 0.1e V t h a t w e c a n\nassume they are relativistic. The energy density of the cosmic neutrino background should\nbe comparable to that of the photons. We will prove this explicitly later when we discuss\nthermal history, but intuitively this makes sense if you consider that relativistic gases in\nstatsitical equilbrium ought to be in equipartition just like a non-relativistic ideal gas. We\nwill show that the cosmic neutrino background has a temperature comparable to but lower\nthan the CMB\nT\u232b =\n\u2713 4\n11\n\u25c61/3\nT\u0000, (8)\nand that the corresponding energy density is\n\u21e2\u232b =3 \u21e5 7\n8 \u21e5\n\u2713 4\n11\n\u25c64/3\n\u21e2\u0000, (9)\nwhere the factor of 3 comes from the three left-handed neutrino \ufb02avors, the factor of 7/8\ncomes from the fact that since neutrinos are fermions their statistical weights are slightly\ndi\u21b5erent than photons which are bosons, and the (4/11)4/3 comes from theT4 dependence\nof the energy density and eqn. (8) forT\u232b.\nAdding in the contribution from neutrinos, we thus \ufb01nd that\n\u21e2r,0 =7 .8 \u21e5 10\u000034 gc m\u00003 or \u2326r,0 \u2318 8.6 \u21e5 10\u00005. (10)\n1.2 Matter Radiation Equality\nNow we have seen that at the present epoch \u2326r,0 \u2327 \u2326m,0. However given that\u21e2m / a\u00003 and\n\u21e2r / a\u00004, there is some point in the past before which radiation dominated (see Fig. 1). We\ncan determine when this occurred by calculating the time at which\n\u21e2m,0a\u00003 = \u21e2r,0a\u00004 ) aeq \u2318 1\n1+ zeq\n= \u21e2r,0\n\u21e2m,0\n= \u2326r,0\n\u2326m,0\n(11)\n2\n20\n3\n0\nwhich is known asmatter-radiation equality.P l u g g i n gi nn u m b e r sw e\ufb01 n d\n1+ zeq =3 5 0 0\n\u2713\u2326m,0\n0.30\n\u25c6\u2713 h\n0.70\n\u25c62\n(12)\n1.3 The Coincidence Problem\nWe can similarly ask when did the dark energy \u2326\u21e4,0 =0 .70 begin to dominate over matter\n\u2326m,0 =0 .30, since matter density scales asa\u00003 in the Friedmann equation whereas the dark\nenergy remains constant with time. This equality occurs at\n1+ zm\u21e4 =1 .33\n\u2713\u2326\u21e4,0/\u2326m,0\n0.70/0.30\n\u25c61/3\n(13)\nor zm\u21e4 =0 .33, which is actually pretty recent (see Fig. 1).\nThis raises the question of why dark energy is just starting to dominate the expansion rate\nnow, or equivalently why\u21e2\u21e4,0/\u21e2m,0 \u21e0O (1), which has been referred to as thecoincidence\nproblem1. The argument goes that one needs very special initial conditions in the early\nuniverse for this to be the case. Explanations for how this could more naturally arise abound.\nOne example is postulating that the energy density of dark energy somehow tracks that in\nmatter. Another is invoking ananthropic argument, i.e. in some ensemble of universes\nonly those in which dark energy comes on the scene late would result in intelligent life that\ncould observe the Universe. None of these explanations are particularly appealing but it is\nsafe to say the coincidence problem is not keeping most cosmologists up at night.\n2 Model Universes\nConsider the simplifying assumption that the Universe is dominated by a single energy com-\nponent. In this case the solutions to the Friedmann equation are analytic and is instructive\nto compute them. Assume a \ufb02at universe \ufb01lled with a single substanceX whose equation of\nstate parameterw implies that it dilutes as\n\u21e2X / a\u00003(1+w), (14)\nas we argued previously from the \ufb02uid equation. In this case the Friedmann equation sim-\npli\ufb01es to\nH2(a)=\n\u2713 \u02d9a\na\n\u25c62\n= H2\n0 \u2326X,0a\u00003(1+w) ) \u02d9a2 = H2\n0 \u2326X,0a\u0000(1+3w), (15)\nwhere H0 is the present day value of the expansion rate and \u2326X,0 = \u21e2X,0/\u21e2c(t0). Note that\neven though this single component approximation is not valid at the present epoch, we are\nstill free to normalize the energy components in terms of\u21e2c,0 using the present day value of\nthe Hubble constant, explaining the appearance ofH0 and \u2326X,0 in the equation above.\n1See https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2509 for a discussion\n3\nFigure 1: Left: Evolution of\u21e2/\u21e2c(t = t0) for radiation, matter, and dark energy.

(22)\nWe will return to this concept of exponential expansion when we discuss the in\ufb02ationary\nepoch.\n3 Distance Measures in Cosmology\n3.1 The Line-of-Sight Comoving Distance\nPreviously we discussed the distinction between the comoving distancer and the proper\ndistance rp.A s m a l l c o m o v i n g d i s t a n c e\u0000r between two nearby objects in the Universe is\nthe distance between them which remains constant with epoch if the two objects are moving\nwith the Hubble \ufb02ow. In other words, if\u0000rp is the proper distance between them which\n5\nwould be measured with rulers at the timete they are being observed, then the comoving\ndistance is this\u0000rp divided by the ratio of the scale factor of the Universe between then and\nnow:\n\u0000r = \u0000rp/a(te)=( 1+ ze)\u0000rp. (23)\nThe total line-of-sight comoving distance r from us to a distant object is computed by\nintegrating the in\ufb01nitesimal \u0000r contributions between nearby events along the radial ray\nfrom z =0( t = t0)t ot h eo b j e c t .

We can then write\ndc = c\nZ z\n0\ndz0\nH(z0) = dH\nZ z\n0\ndz0\nE(z0), (26)\nwhere we have de\ufb01ned theHubble distance\ndH \u2318 cH\u00001\n0 =4 .3\n\u2713 h\n0.70\n\u25c6\u00001\nGpc, (27)\nwrote the Hubble constant today as\nH0 =7 0\n\u2713 h\n0.70\n\u25c6\nkm s\u00001 Mpc\u00001, (28)\nand used the fact thatH(z)= H0E(z)w h e r e\nE(z)=\n\u21e5\n\u2326m,0a\u00003 +\u2326 r,0a\u00004 +\u2326 v,0 +\u2326 k,0a\u00002\u21e41/2\n. (29)\nNote that the line-of-sight comoving distance is not directly observable. Nevertheless, in\nsome sense it is the fundamental distance measure in cosmology since, as we will see below,\nall the other distance measures can be simply expressed in terms of it.\n3.2 Angular Diameter Distance\nSuppose that we can observe some yardstick whose proper length` is known at a cosmological\ndistance. Imagine this yardstick to be aligned perpendicular to our line of sight as illustrated\n6\nv\nz\nf\nFigure 2: An observer at the origin observes a yardstick of proper length` at a comoving\ndistance r. Figure from Ryden.\nin Fig. 2, such that it has\u0000=constant, subtends an angle\u0000\u2713 on the sky where\u0000\u2713 \u2327 1, and\nthat the light from this yardstick has a redshift ofz corresponding to some cosmic timete.\nThe angular diameter distance is de\ufb01ned by\ndA = `\n\u0000\u2713 , (30)\nin other words it is equal to the familiar proper distance to the yardstick in the small angle\nlimit that would hold if the universe were static and Euclidean.\nTo determine the relationship betweendA and the comoving distancedc we derived above,\nrecall that the metric tells us us how to compute proper distances, and that the proper\ndistance between two points is equal to the length of the spatial geodesic between them with\ntime \ufb01xed at somete and thus with the scale factora(te)a l s o\ufb01 x e d ,i no t h e rw o r d sdt =0\nds2 = a2(te)\n\u21e5\ndr2 + S2\nk(r)d\u23262\u21e4\n. (31)\nThus the distance between two ends of the yardstick in Fig. (2) for which\u0000=const and\nr=const\nds = a(te)Sk(r)d\u2713. (32)\nSetting ds = ` and d\u2713 = \u0000\u2713 we deduce\n` = a(te)Sk(r)\u0000\u2713 = Sk(r)\u0000\u2713\n1+ z . (33)\n7\nUsing the de\ufb01nition ofdA above we then have\ndA = `\n\u0000\u2713 = Sk(r)\n1+ z . (34)\nWe will typically focus on the casek =0f o rw h i c hSk(r)= r,s u c ht h a tt h ec o m o v i n g\ndistance to a distant object which emitted light atte corresponding to redshiftz is just the\nline-of-sight comoving distancedc that we calculated above, thus we \ufb01nd\ndA = dc(z)\n1+ z.

Figure from Ryden.\n3.3 Luminosity Distance\nAnother important distance measure is the luminosity distancedL.I m a g i n et h a tw eh a v ea\nsource whose luminosityL is known as depicted in Fig. 4. HereL is the bolometric luminosity\nwhich is the speci\ufb01c luminosityL\u0000 integrated over all wavelengths\u0000.I fw em e a s u r et h e\ufb02 u x\nof this objectf (similarly integrated over all wavelengths) on Earth, we de\ufb01ne the luminosity\ndistance by\ndL \u2318\n\u2713 L\n4\u21e1f\n\u25c61/2\n. (36)\nAnalogous to the angular diameter distance, this is what the proper distance to the source\nwould be if the universe were static and Euclidean, since the dilutuion of light would follow\nthe inverse square lawf = L/(4\u21e1d2).\nLet us derive what the luminosity distancedL should be by calculating what the \ufb02ux should\nbe on Earth, which we can always do by working with physical quantities (i.e. proper\ntime, proper distance, observed energy). There are three e\u21b5ects we need to consider in an\nexpanding universe:\n1. At the time timet0 that the light reaches earth, we want to calculate the proper area\nof a sphere drawn around the source and passing through Earth. Again, since we want\nap r o p e ra r e a ,t h i sc a nb ed e t e r m i n e df r o mt h em e t r i c ,i no t h e rw o r d sf o rs o m es o l i d\nangle d\u2326a tt h es o u r c es u b t e n d e db yad i \u21b5 e r e n t i a la r e adA on Earth we have\ndA = a2(t0)S2\nk(r)d\u2326. (37)\nNoting that the scale factor is evaluated atz =0( t = t0)w h i c hi sa(t0) = 1 and\n9\n\u02c7\nintegrating over solid angle we obtain:\nA =4 \u21e1S2\nk(r). (38)\n2. Redshifting of the photons due to the expansion of the universe causes the energy of\neach photon from the source to decrease. If the a photon starts with energyEe = h\u232be\nwhen the scale factor isa(te), it arrives at Earth with energyE0 = h\u232b0 = h\u232bea(te)=\nh\u232be/(1 +z)r e d u c e db yaf a c t o ro f( 1+z).\n3. Time dilation implies that the time between the photon detections on Earth att0 is\nlonger than the time between photon emissions att = te. If two photons emitted in the\nsame direction are separated by a time interval\u0000te the proper distance between them\nwill initially bec\u0000te corresponding to a comoving distancec\u0000te/a(te). By the time we\ndetect these photons on Earth the proper distance between them will bec\u0000tea(t0)/\na(te)= c\u0000t0,s ow es e et h a t\u0000t0 =( 1+ z)\u0000te.\nPutting this all together we arrive at the correct formula for the observed \ufb02ux on Earth from\nour source of luminosityL at redshiftz:\nf = L\n4\u21e1S2\nk(R)(1 +z)2 , (39)\nwhich combined with the de\ufb01nition of luminosity distance in eqn. (36) gives\ndL = Sk(r)(1 +z), (40)\nfrom which we immediately see that\ndL =( 1+ z)2dA. (41)\nFor the case where space is \ufb02at recall that\ndA = dc/(1 +z)( 4 2 )\nand so\ndL =( 1+ z)dc. (43)\nFig. 5 shows the luminosity distancedL as a function of redshift for the Benchmark Model and\nfor two other \ufb02at universes, one dominated by matter and one dominated by a cosmological\nconstant.\n3.4 Lookback Time\nThe lookback timetL to an object is the di\u21b5erence betweeen the aget0 of the universe now\n(at observation) and the agete of the universe at the time photons were emitted by some\nobject. It is used to compare the properties of distant high-redshift objects with evolutionary\nmodels and to quote an overall age of the universe.

It is the proper volume\ntimes three factors of the relative scale factor now to then, (1 +z)3. According to eqn. (26),\nthe derivative of comoving distance is\nd\ndz(dc)= dH\nE(z). (47)\nThe angular diameter distancedA squared converts a solid angled\u2326i n t oap r o p e ra r e adAp,\nthen to get a comoving areadAc requires that we divide by two factors of the scale factor or\nmultiply by (1 +z)2\ndAc =( 1+ z)2dAp = d2\nA(1 +z)2d\u2326. (48)\nTo get the di\u21b5erential comoving volume elementdVC associated with a solid angled\u2326a n d\nredshift intervaldz,w et h u sm u p l t i p l yd\ndz (dc)b ydAc which gives\ndVc = dH\n(1 +z)2d2\nA\nE(z) d\u2326dz, (49)\nor\nd2Vc\ndzd\u2326 = dH\n(1 +z)2d2\nA\nE(z) (50)\nBy integrating this expression over some redshift redshift intervalz1 to z2 and some solid\nangle (4\u21e1 for the entire sky), the total comoving volume can be computed. The comoving\nvolume element and its integral are both used frequently in predicting number counts or\nluminosity densities of extragalactic objects.\n12\nPhys 236: Cosmology\nLecture 5-7: Thermal History\nAn important feature of the standard cosmology is that the temperature of the Universe was\narbitrarily high at the earliest times shortly after the Big Bang. Recall that we derived the\nscalings\nT\n1010 K \u21e0 kBT\n1M e V\u21e0\n\uf8ff \u21e2\n107 gc m\u00003\n\u00001/4\n\u21e0 1+ z\n1010 \u21e0\n\uf8ff t\n1s\n\u0000\u00001/2\n, (1)\nand thus the temperature is decreasing continuously as a function of time. We derived this\nscaling via a simple application of thermodynamics to a small patch of the homogeneous and\nisotropic Universe. In the next few lectures we will show that this thermal history combined\nwith statistical mechanics, particle, nuclear, and atomic physics, allows a detailed prediction\nof the matter content of the universe at each epoch.\n1 General Overview\nPreviously we used the \ufb01rst law of thermodyanmics\ndQ = TdS = dE + PdV, (2)\nand made the assumption that the expansion is adiabaticdQ = TdS =0t od e r i v et h e\ufb02 u i d\nequation\n\u02d9\u21e2 +3 \u02d9a\na (\u21e2 + p)=0 . (3)\nIn deriving the \ufb02uid equation we have made a very strong assumption: the universe is\ncomprised of perfect \ufb02uids which evolve according to a sequence of adiabatic reversible\ntransformations dS = 0, i.e. at each instant the universe is in an equilibrium state. Although\nthe treatment of the contents of the universe as perfect \ufb02uids allowed us to derive the basic\nequations governing the expansion of the universe, it is not su\u0000cient for detailed study\nof the behavior and interactions of realistic particles at high temperature. For this we\nneed to use statistical mechanics to describe the distribution functions of the Universe\u2019s\nconstituent particles, and we need to think very carefully about what it means to be in\nthermal equilibrium. It could be that some particles are in equlibrium with each other,\nwhereas others are not.\nFor example previously we discussed that the Universe is currently permeated with a cosmic\nbackground of relativistic neutrinos as well as the cosmic microwave background. Whereas\nthe CMB is a black-body radiation \ufb01eld atT0 =2 .73 K, the cosmic neutrino background has\nan equilibrium distribution with a di\u21b5erent lower temperatureT\u232b,0 =1 .95 K. The di\u21b5erence\nin these temperatures results from the neutrinos dropping out of equilibrium with the photons\naround one second after the Big Bang. We will discuss this in more detail later, and actually\nderive this temperature di\u21b5erence.\nAs we will see the most general non-equilibrium description of the coupled distributions\nof particle species comes from solving the Boltzman equation. In this context, thermal\n1\nequilibrium dS =0a r i s e sa s s u m i n ge i t h e rn oi n t e r a c t i o n sa m o n gp a r t i c l e s( e . g . a d i a b a t i c\nexpansion), or by assuming a very high rate of interactions such that thermal equilbrium\nbetween di\u21b5erent species can be achieved. The latter scenario is the key to undersatnding\nthe thermal history of the universe. Speci\ufb01cally we will compare therate of interactions\n\u0000t ot h erate of expansionH. When \u0000\u0000 H,t h e nt h et i m es c a l eo fp a r t i c l ei n t e r a c t i o n s\nis much smaller than the characteristic expansion time scale:\ntc \u2318 1\n\u0000 \u2327 tH \u2318 1\nH , (4)\nthen thermal equilibrium will be reached before the e\u21b5ect of the expansion cooling becomes\nrelevant. Particles interact so frequently that they do not care about the cosmological\nexpansion \u2013 any change in their energy density is rapidly shared among other particles\nvia these rapid interactions maintaining thermal equilibrium. For a given particle species\nthe interaction rate is de\ufb01ned by\n\u0000 \u2318 n\u0000vrel = vrel\n\u0000mfp\n, (5)\nwhere n is the number density of projectile particles,vrel is the relative velocity between\nprojectiles and targets, and\u0000 is the interaction cross section, and the last equality used the\nde\ufb01nition of the mean free path\u0000mfp =1 /(n\u0000). Thus the condition \u0000\u0000 H can be thought\nof equivalently as saying that the particle mean free path\n\u0000mfp \u2327 vtH (6)\nis much shorter than the distance it can travel in the Hubble timetH,o ri ft h ep a r t i c l ei s\nrelativistic that the mean free path is much shorter than the Hubble distancedH = c/H.\nNote that \u0000 is di\u21b5erent for di\u21b5erent fundamental interactions and for di\u21b5erent particle species\nand masses. Therefore, the above condition in eqn. (4) is valid for all the known (and perhaps\nunknown) particles in the very early universe but, as the universe expands, it is eventually\nbroken at di\u21b5erent times for di\u21b5erent species. This is the essence of thethermal history\nof the universe.\nAt the very beginning (we are talking about tiny fractions of seconds after the Big Bang)\nall the particles were in thermal equilibrium in a primordial soup known as theprimordial\nplasma,w h i c hi so f t e na l s or e f e r r e dt oa st h eprimordial radiation bath. When for a\nspecies, the condition \u0000\u21e0 H is reached, it decouples from the primordial plasma. If it\ndoes this by breaking the chemical equilibrium of some reaction (for example pair production\ne\u0000 + e+ $ \u0000 + \u0000), then this reaction is said tofreeze out and the products attain some\n\ufb01xed relic abundance.1\nThe fundamental interactions which characterize the aforementioned processes compel some\nparticles to react and transform into others and vice-versa. When \u0000\u0000 H these reactions\ntake place with equal probability in both directions, hence the$ symbol, but when \u0000\u21e0 H\neventually one direction is preferred over the other. This is the characteristic of irreversibility\n1It attains a \ufb01xed abundance if it is a stable particle, of course. If not it disappears.\n2\no wet\nwhich causes equilibrium thermodynamics to fail, and thus demands the use of the Boltzmann\nequation. For example, we shall use the Boltzmann equation to calculate the relic abundance\nof CDM, quantify the recombination of protons and electrons into neutral hydrogen atoms,\nand analyze the formation of light elements duringBig Bang Nucleosynthesis.\n2 Brief Summary of Thermal History\nIn what follows we give a brief overview of some of the most important events that took\nplace in the early thermal history of the Universe.\nPlanck scale, in\ufb02ation, and Grand Uni\ufb01ed TheoryIn principle, ast !1 a(t) ! 0,\nbut there comes a point at which this extrapolation of General Relativity, which is not a\nquantum theory of gravity, must break down. This is when the thermal energy of typical\nparticles is such that their de Brogile wavelength is smaller than their Schwarzschild radius:\nquantum black holes clearly cause di\u0000culties with the usual concept of background space-\ntime. Equating 2\u21e1~/(mc)w i t h2Gm/c2 yields a characteristic mass for quantum gravity\nknown as thePlanck mass. This mass, and the corresponding length`Pl = ~/(mPlc), and\ntime `Pl/c form the sytem ofPlanck units:\nmPl \u2318\nr\n~c\nG ' 1019 GeV (7)\n`Pl \u2318\nr\n~G\nc3 ' 10\u000035 m( 8 )\ntPl \u2318\nr\n~G\nc5 ' 10\u000043 s( 9 )\nThe Planck time thus sets the origin of time for the classical phase of the Big Bang. Another\ncommonly used Planck mass unit is\nMPl \u2318\nr\n~c\n8\u21e1G =2 .4 \u21e5 1018 GeV, (10)\nwhere a factor of 8\u21e1 is introduced in the square root. The reason for this is that at early times\nwhen the curvature term/ a\u00002 in the Friedmann equation is negligibly small compared to\nthe steepera dependence of the components of\u21e2, one can then write the Friedmann equation\nas\nH2 = \u21e2\n3M2\nPl\n, (11)\nin particle physics units where~ =1 .\nIn\ufb02ation is another very important piece of the current description of the primordial universe.\nWe shall dedicate a lecture to it later on. For now, it is su\u0000cient to say that it occurs at\nan energy scale of the order 1016 GeV, which is the same scale as the Grand Uni\ufb01ed Theory\n(GUT), i.e. models in which electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions are uni\ufb01ed.\nBaryogenesis and LeptogenesisRelativistic quantum \ufb01eld theory requires the existence\nof anti-particles, which poses a slight puzzle. Particles and anti-particles annihilate through\n3\nprocesses such as\ne\u0000 + e+ $ \u0000 + \u0000. (12)\nIf initally the universe was \ufb01lled with equal amounts of matter and anti-matter then we\nexpect these annihilations to lead to a universe dominated by radiation. Basically, once\nthe universe cools down below the mass energy of some baryon or lepton,kBT . mc2,p a i r\nproduction from the primordial plasma will eventually become energetically unfavorable and\nthe reaction will no longer proceed to the left to produce particles and anti-particles. Instead\nall the matter and anti-matter will annihilate away leaving a universe \ufb01lled with radiation.\nHowever, we do observe an overabundance of matter (mostly baryons) over anti-matter in\nthe universe today. In order for this to be the case there needs to be some primordial matter-\nantimatter asymmetry in the inital conditions. In other words, baryogenesis is the creation,\nvia some as of yet unclear mechanism, of an overall positive baryon number. In order to\nmaintain the neutrality of the universe, we thus also need Leptogenesis, i.e. a mechanism\nwhich produces a non-vanishing lepton number in the form of an excess of electrons over\npositrons. Although many ideas for baryogenesis exist, none is singled out by experimental\ntests. We will not have much to say about baryogenesis in this course.\nElectroweak phase transitionAt a thermal energy of about 100 GeV, which corresponds\nto 10\u000012 seconds after the Big Bang, the electromagnetic and weak forces start to behave\ndistinctly. This leads to a drastic change in the strength of the weak interaction which results\nin a phase transition.\nQCD phase transitionBelow 150 MeV quarks pass from their asymptotic freedom and\nbound states form from two (mesons) or three (baryons) of them. The above energy corre-\nsponds roughly to 20\u00b5sa f t e rt h eB i gB a n g .\nDark matter freeze-outSince dark matter is very weakly interacting with ordinary matter\nwe expect it to decouple relatively early on. We will study the example of WIMPs \u2013 weakly\ninteracting massive particles that freeze out around 10\u0000100 GeV. We will show that choosing\nnatural values for the mass of the dark matter particles and their interaction cross section\nwith ordinary matter reproduces the observed relic dark matter density surprisingly well.\nNeutrino decouplingAt T \u21e0 1010 K corresponding to an energy around 1 MeV, or around\n1 s after the Big Bang a host of interactions between neutrinos/anti-neutrinos, leptons (elec-\ntrons/positrons) and baryons (protons and neutrons) become ine\u21b5ecient and neutrinos drop\nout of thermal equilibrium with the primordial plasma. After this neutrinos decouple and\nsimply redshift away their energy until the present epoch, but their contribution to the total\nradiation energy density of the universe is not negligible. It thus alters when matter radiation\nequality takes place, and as a result the strength of anisotropies in the CMB.\nElectron-positron annihilationThe interaction\ne\u0000 + e+ $ \u0000 + \u0000, (13)\nwill remain in thermal equilibrium provided the energykBT of the primordial plasma is\nlarger than the mass of electrons and positronsmec2 = 511 keV. When the temperature of\nthe thermal bath drops below this value pair production is no longer possible and annihilation\n4\ntakes over. The entropy and energy from these electron/positron pairs is then transferred\nto the photon bath, but since the neutrinos already decoupled earlier, this explains the\nsmall temperature di\u21b5erence between the nutrinos and the CMB today, which we will derive\nexplicitly. Thanks to leptogenesis, positrons disappear and only electrons are left.\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)At t\u21e0 af e wm i n u t e s(T \u21e0 109 K) , nucleosynthesis\nstarts, synthesizing protons and neutrons to produce D, He and a few other elements. Since\nthe temperature is still too high for the formation of neutral atoms, all these elements are\nhighly ionized.\nRecombination At T \u21e0 4000 K (t \u21e0 2 \u21e5 105 yr) roughly 50% of the baryonic matter is in\nthe form of neutral atoms. This point in time is often called the time ofrecombination.\nBecause of the resulting drop in the number density of free electrons, the universe suddenly\nbecomes transparent to photons which is known asdecoupling.T h e s e p h o t o n s a r e o b s e r v e d\ntoday as the cosmic microwave background. From this point on, photons, neutrinos, H, He\nand other atoms all expand freely with the Universe. Just before this time, the energy\ndensity in relativistic particles became smaller than that in the rest mass of non-relativistic\nmatter, and the Universe enters the matter dominated epoch.\n3 Equilibrium Thermodynamics\n3.1 A Note on Units\nWe will always keep units throughout all of our calculations. But as the study of the thermal\nhistory of the universe is concerned with high energy physics, you will often see results in\nother references in the natural unit system in which the speed of lightc,B o l t z m a n n \u2019 s\nconstant kB,a n dP l a n c k \u2019 sc o n s t a n t~ = hP /2\u21e1 are all set to 1. In cgs units [c]=c m s\u00001,\n[~]=g c m2 s\u00001,a n d[kB]=g c m2 s\u00002 K\u00001.T h e r e f o r e , m a k i n g t h e s e c o n s t a n t s d i m e n s i o n l e s s\nimplies that\n[energy] = [mass] = [temperature] = [time]\u00001 =[ l e n g t h ]\u00001, (14)\nand all physical quantities can be expressed in one unit, which is usually energy. Another\nway to state this is that in SI units the fundamental units are mass, length, and time\nwhereas in natural units the fundamental units are velocity, action (energy\u21e5 time), and\nenergy. Since we have set the velocity unitc =1a n dt h ea c t i o nu n i t~ =1 ,t h eo n l y\nremaining thing with dimensions is energy. The unit of choice for energy is the \u201celectron-\nvolt\u201d, where the energy scales are eV in atomic physics, MeV in nuclear physics, and GeV in\nparticle physics. Whenever needed, the \u2018missing\u2019 powers ofc, kB,a n d~ in equations can be\nreinserted straightforwardly from simple dimensional analysis. Appendix C.1 of Baumann\u2019s\nbook has a nice explanation of natural units and how to convert into SI units.\nOne useful thing to note is that number densities in these natural units will typically be\nexpressed as\nn \u21e0 T3 or n \u21e0 (mT)3/2, (15)\n5\nwhich in normal units become\nn \u21e0\n\u2713kBT\n~c\n\u25c63\nor n \u21e0\n\u2713mc2kBT\n~2c2\n\u25c63/2\n\u21e0\n\u2713mkBT\n~2\n\u25c63/2\n. (16)\nFrom these the units of energy density or pressure then just have an extra factor of energy\nmultiplied in, and it should be obvious which constant is needed to get the correct units.\n3.2 Distribution Functions\nFigure 1: Phase space of position and momentum in one dimension. Volume of each cell\nis 2\u21e1~, the smallest region into which a particle can be con\ufb01ned because of Heisenberg\u2019s\nuncertainty principle. Shaded region has in\ufb01nitesmal volumedxdp which covers nine cells.\nTo count the appropriate number of cells, therefore, the phase space integral must be\nR\ndxdp/\n(2\u21e1~)\nAs we discussed, through most of the early universe, reactions proceeded rapidly enough\nto keep particles in equilibrium, such that di\u21b5erent species share a common temperature.\nWe will often want to express the number density, energy density, pressure, etc. in terms\nof this temperature. For this reason, and many others which will emerge shortly, it is\nconvenient to introduce the occupation number, ordistribution function f of a species.\nThis distribution function counts the number of particles in a given region in phase space2\n2Note that here we are working in proper coordinates, i.e.x is a proper position coordinate, and byp\n6\naround a positionx and momentump. Then if we want to determine the energy of a species\nwe would construct the weighted sum of the energy of each state over all of the phase space\nelements: Pf(x, p)E(p).\nHow many phase space elements are there in a region of \u201cvolume\u201ddx3dp3? By Heisenberg\u2019s\nuncertainty principle, no particle can be localized into a region of phase space smaller than\n(2\u21e1~)3, so this is the size of a fundamental element. Therefore, the number of phase space\nelements indx3dp3 is dx3dp3/(2\u21e1~)3 (see Fig. 1). Homogeneity implies that this distribution\nfunction should be independent of positionx,a n di s o t r o p yr e q u i r e st h a tf = f(p)d e p e n d s\nonly on the magnitude of the momentump \u2318| p|.W e c a n t h u s i n t e g r a t e o u t t h e s p a t i a l p a r t\nover the volume to obtain that the density in phase space is the density of states times the\ndistribution function g\n(2\u21e1~)3 \u21e5 f(p), (17)\nwhere g is a degeneracy factor which counts internal degrees of freedom (e.g. spin). The\nnumber densityof particles (in real space) is found by integrating eqn. (17) over momentum\nn = g\n(2\u21e1~)3\nZ\nd3pf(p). (18)\nTo obtain the energy density of the gas particles we have to weight each momentum by\nits energy. To a very good approximation the particles in the early universe were weakly\ninteracting. This allows us to ignore the interaction energies between the particles and simply\nwrite that the energy of a particle of massm and momentump simply as\nE(p)=\np\nm2c4 + p2c2. (19)\nThis then implies that the energy density is\n\u21e2 = g\n(2\u21e1~)3\nZ\nd3pf(p)E(p). (20)\nand the pressure is\nP = g\n(2\u21e1~)3\nZ\nd3pf(p) p2c2\n3E(p), (21)\nwhere the last equation for the pressureP comes from a generalization of the standard\nkinetic theory derivation of the pressure of an ideal gas to the case of a relativistic gas (see\nMukhanov Physical Foundations of Cosmology\u00a7 3.3.2 for a derviation). It is immediately\nclear that if the particles are relativisticE2 \u21e1 p2c2 (see eqn. 19) that eqn. (21) then implies\nP = \u21e2/3o rw =1 /3a sw ea r g u e dp r e v i o u s l yi st h ec a s ef o rr a d i a t i o n .\nhere we mean the not the comoving momentum but rather the proper momentum which redshifts away with\nthe expansion.\n7\n3.3 Equilibrium Distribution Functions\nTo properly describe the physical processes in an expanding universe including departures\nfrom equilibrium, we need, strictly speaking, a full kinetic theory which we will come to\nlater. Fortunately, there are many situations in the early universe when the particles are\nin a state of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) with each other. We qualify\nthis equilibrium with the word local to stress that the Universe cannot be treated as a\ntypical thermodynamic system in equilibrium with an in\ufb01nite thermal bath at some given\ntemperature: it is a dynamically evolving nonequilibrium system. More concretely, we know\nthat the temperature of the thermal bath changes as the universe expands. Therefore, by\nlocal equilibrium we simply mean that matter has maximal possible entropy. In practice\nentropy will be maximized for a species when \u0000\u0000 H as we discussed already. We will come\nto an even clearer de\ufb01nition of what is meant by LTE shortly.\nIt can be shown that for a system of particles constrained to have a \ufb01xed amount of total\nenergy E and number of particlesN the entropy is maximized, and thus the system is in\nLTE, when its particles have the following distribution function\nf(p)= 1\ne(E(p)\u0000\u00b5)/kBT \u00b1 1, (22)\nwhere the + sign is for fermions (electrons, or baryons, i.e. protons and neutrons) which obey\nFermi-Dirac statistics and the\u0000 for bosons (photons) which obey Bose-Einstein statistics.\nAt low temperatures kBT \u2327 E \u0000 \u00b5,b o t hd i s t r i b u t i o nf u n c t i o n sr e d u c et ot h eM a x w e l l -\nBoltzmann distribution\nf(p) \u21e1 e\u0000(E(p)\u0000\u00b5)/kBT . (23)\nThe equilibrium distribution functions have two parameters: the temperatureT and the\nchemical potential \u00b5,w h e r et h ec h e m i c a lp o t e n t i a lc a nb et e m p e r a t u r ed e p e n d e n t .

Speci\ufb01cally, it is de\ufb01ned as the derivative of the entropy with respect to\nthe number of particlesN,a t\ufb01 x e de n e r g ya n d\ufb01 x e dv o l u m e ,m u l t i p l i e db yt h et e m p e r a t u r e\n\u00b5 = \u0000T\n\u2713 @S\n@N\n\u25c6\nE,V\n. (24)\nTaking into account the possibility of changing particle number, the \ufb01rst law of thermody-\nnamics becomes\ndQ = TdS = dE + PdV \u0000 \u00b5dN, (25)\nwhere \u00b5dN is sometimes called thechemical work.\n8\nNow let us consider some reaction that is capable of changing members of one species into\nmembers of another species. We will denote this reaction in the following form:\n\u232b1A1 + \u232b2A2 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \u232blAl =\nX\nj\n\u232bjAj =0 . (26)\nThe coe\u0000cients\u232bl are known as the stoichiometric factors, and they simply specify how the\nnumbers of the di\u21b5erent species are related. For example, consider the reaction\n2H2 +O 2 $ 2H2O. (27)\nIn this caseA1 =H 2, A2 =O 2, A3 =H 2O, \u232b1 =2 , \u232b2 =1 ,a n d\u232b3 = \u00002. The meaning of\nthis is that every forward reaction destroys 2 H2 molecules and 1 O2 molecule, and produces\n2H 2Om o l e c u l e s .\nIn LTE we know thatdS =0w h i c ht h e ni m p l i e s\ndS =\nX\ni\n@S\n@Ni\ndNi = \u0000\nX\ni\n\u00b5i\nTi\ndNi = \u0000\nX\ni\n\u00b5i\nT dNi =0 \u0000!\nX\ni\n\u00b5idNi =0 , (28)\nwhere the last equality used the fact that the temperatures must all be the same in equi-\nlibrium Ti = T.I f t h i s c o n d i t i o nP\ni \u00b5idNi =0w e r en o ts a t i s \ufb01 e dt h e nt h ep a r t i c l e sc o u l d\nconvert into each other to increase the entropy further violating our assumption (dS =0 )o f\nLTE.\nBut given the de\ufb01nition of chemical potential, a single forward reaction results in the follow-\ning change in the entropy\n\u0000\nX\ni\n\u232bi\n\u00b5i\nTi\n, (29)\nand the negative of this for a backward reaction. Thus we can identify dNi = \u232bi.I n\nequilibrium whereT = Ti the condition thatdS =0t h u si m p l i e si nt e r m so ft h es t o c h i o m e t r i c\nfactors X\ni\n\u232bi\u00b5i =0 , (30)\nThe equation above de\ufb01nes what we will refer to aschemical equilibrium.\nIf the number of particles is not constrained then the chemical potential is zero. For example\nfor black body radiation which is an equilibrium con\ufb01gruation, the number of photons in\nthe system is not conserved. A photon may collide with an electron in the wall of the\ncavity, exciting it to a higher energy state, removing a photon from the photon gas. This\nelectron may drop back to its lower level in a series of steps, each one of which releases an\nindividual photon back into the photon gas. Although the sum of the photon energies of\nthe emitted photons are the same as the absorbed photon, the number of emitted photons\nwill vary. Another simple example of photon non-conservation is double Compton scattering\ne\u0000 + \u0000 $ e\u0000 + \u0000 + \u0000 which happens in equilibrium at high-temperatures. The only way that\n9\nthese changes in photon number can maintaindS =0i si f @S/@N =0 ,i m p l y i n g\n\u00b5\u0000 =0 . (31)\nThis implies that if the chemical potential of a particleX is \u00b5X,t h e nt h ec h e m i c a lp o t e n t i a l\nof the corresponding anti-particle\u00afX is\n\u00b5 \u00afX = \u0000\u00b5X. (32)\nTo see this, just consider particle-antiparticle annihilation,X + \u00afX $ \u0000 + \u0000.\nFor the purposes of computing the equilibrium distribution functions we will be able to ignore\nthe chemical potentials because it can be shown that they are negligibly small compared to\nkBT.Y o u w i l l s h o w t h a t t h i s i s t h e c a s e i n t h e h o m e w o r k .B u t f o r s i t u a t i o n s w h e r e w e a r e\ntrying to study chemical equilibrium, we will of course not be able to neglect them.\nFinally, we can now make the distinction betweenkinetic equilibrium and chemical\nequilibrium.C o n s i d e rar e a c t i o nf o rw h i c h\u0000\u0000 H of the type:\nA + B $ C + D, (33)\nor in terms of chemical potentials,\n\u00b5A + \u00b5B = \u00b5C + \u00b5D, (34)\nwhich we de\ufb01ne aschemical equilibrium.\nOn the other hand, when \u0000\u0000 H refers to a reaction such as scattering:\nA + B $ A + B, (35)\nthis is referred to askinetic equilibrium. Mathematically kinetic equilibrium implies that\nthe distribution functions for both species A and B are of the form given in eqn. (22) at the\nsame temperature T.\nIn general, it is possible for a species to break chemical equilibrium and still remain in kinetic\nequilibrium with the rest of the cosmic plasma through scattering processes. We will thus use\nLTE to refer to a situation where the particles under consideration are in kinetic or chemical\nequilibrium (or both). In practical terms LTE will mean the particles under consideration\nshare a common equilibrium temperature Ti = T, and often this temperature T will be\nidenti\ufb01ed with the photon temperatureT\u0000 which we will refer to as the \u201ctemperature of the\nuniverse\u201d.\n3.5 Expressions for n, \u21e2, andP\nGiven the distribution function, we can then calculate the number densityn,e n e r g yd e n s i t y\n\u21e2 and pressure P. In what follows we will work out two important special cases, namely\nrelativistic and non-relativistic particles.\n10\n3.5.1 Relativistic Species: mc2 \u2327 kBT, |\u00b5|\u2327 kBT\nIn the relativistic limit, we can write the energy asE = pc.G o i n g t h r o u g h t h e m a t h o n e\n\ufb01nds for the number density\nn = g(kBT)3\u21e3(3)\n\u21e12~3c3\n\u21e2 1b o s o n s\n3\n4 fermions , (36)\nenergy density\n\u21e2 = g(kBT)4\u21e12\n30~3c3\n\u21e2 1b o s o n s\n7\n8 fermions , (37)\nand pressure\nP = \u21e2\n3 . (38)\nThere are several points here that are worth noting. First, we have now derived from\nstatistical mechanics the equation of state for radiation, and indeed we \ufb01nd thatw = P/\n\u21e2 =1 /3. Second, plugging in numbers for photons which are bosons withg =2w ea r i v ea t\nthe Stefan-Boltzmann relation\n\u21e2\u0000 = aRT4 =4 \u0000SBT4/c; \u0000SB \u2318 k4\nB\u21e12\n60~3c2 =5 .6704 \u21e5 10\u00008Js\u00001m\u00002K\u00004. (39)\nwhere the Stefan-Boltzmann constant is de\ufb01ned above.\n3.5.2 Non-Relativistic Species: mc2 \u0000 kBT, |\u00b5|\u2327 kBT\nIn the limitmc2 \u0000 kBT and |\u00b5|\u2327 kBT we can use the fact thatv2/c2 \u21e0 kBT/(mc2) \u2327 1\n(i.e. v2 \u21e0 kBT/m is the rms velocity of an ideal gas), and hencep2/(m2c2)= v2/c2 \u2327 1.\nThen we can expand the energy to \ufb01rst order inp2/(m2c)2 to obtain\nE =\np\nm2c4 + p2c2 \u21e1 mc2 + p2\n2m. (40)\nIn the non-relativistic limit, the equilibrium distribution functionf(p)a l s oa s s u m e st h e\nMaxwell-Boltzmann form (see eqn. 23), sincemc2 \u0000 kBT implies kBT \u2327 E \u0000\u00b5.C o m b i n i n g\nthese two approximations, eqn. (18) for the particle number density integrates to\nn = g\n\u2713mkBT\n2\u21e1~2\n\u25c63/2\ne\u0000mc2/kBT . (41)\nSo we \ufb01nd that in the non-relativistic limit massive particles are exponentially rare at tem-\nperatures much smaller than their rest-mass energykBT \u2327 mc2.I n a d d i t i o n , p l u g g i n g\neqn. (40) into eqn. (20) gives\n\u21e2 = n(mc2 + 3\n2kBT) \u21e1 nmc2. (42)\n11\nAnalogously for the pressure P,w o r k i n gt o\ufb01 r s to r d e ri np2/(m2c2)i ne q n .( 2 1 )m e a n s\nexpanding E(p)=\np\nm2c4 + p2c2 ' mc2 to zeroth order, it then immediately follows that\nP ' nkBT \u2327 \u21e2 (P ' 0) , (43)\nor w = P/\u21e2 = 0 for matter. Which is the full derivation of what we concluded before, that\nnon-relativistic matter behaves like a dust \ufb02uid.\n3.6 Interpretation\nBy comparing the relativistic limit (kBT \u0000 mc2)a n dt h en o n - r e l a t i v i s t i cl i m i t(kBT \u2327\nmc2), we see that the number density, energy density, and pressure of a particle species\nfall exponentially (are \u201cBoltzmann suppressed\u201d) as the temperature drops below the mass\nof the particle. This re\ufb02ects the coupling to the photon \ufb02uid in the primordial plasma\nat the equilibrium temperature. When kBT \u0000 mc2 the photons have su\u0000cient energy to\ncreate a thermal background number density of particle-antiparticle pairs. However, when\nkBT \u2327 mc2 only an exponential tail of the photon distribution function has su\u0000cient energy\nfor pair creation, causing a similar suppression of their number density.\nThis exponential suppression has several important consequences. First it implies that non-\nrelativistic particles either become exponentially rare, or that their numbers drop below the\ndensity where they interact su\u0000ciently often to stay in equilibrium (recall tht \u0000 =n\u0000v)a n d\nhence they go out of equilibrium ordecouple and the interactions are said tofreeze out.\nBoth cases are of interest.\nFor example, electrons and positrons interact very strongly via the Coulomb force and so\nmaintain equilibrium until there are almost no positrons left atkBT \u2327 mec2 \u21e0 0.5M e V( t h e y\nall annihilate with electrons). Other particles that interact weakly, likeweakly-interacting\nmassive particlesor WIMPs,w h i c ha r ead a r km a t t e rc a n d i d a t e ,w o u l ds i m p l yr a p i d l y\ndrop out of equilibrium and hencefreeze out,p o s s i b l yg i v i n gr i s et oas i g n i \ufb01 c a n tr e l i c\nabundance of matter (indeed this is why they are a dark matter candidate, as we will\ndiscuss).\nFinally, we observe that particles following these equilibrium distributionscan only contribute\nsigni\ufb01cantly to the energy density and pressure when they are relativistic.Thus if we have a\ncollection of relativistic species, each of them having an equilbirium at di\u21b5erent temperatures\nTi,w ec a nw r i t et h et o t a le n e r g yd e n s i t y ,\u21e2R,a sas u mo v e ra l lt h ec o n t r i b u t i o n s\n\u21e2R =\nX\ni\n\u21e2i = \u21e12\n30~3c3 g?(T\u0000)(kBT\u0000)4, (44)\nwhere we have introducedg?,t h ee\u21b5ective number of degrees of freedom,g i v e nb y\ng?(T\u0000) \u2318\nX\nbosons\ngi\n\u2713 Ti\nT\u0000\n\u25c64\n+ 7\n8\nX\nfermions\ngi\n\u2713 Ti\nT\u0000\n\u25c64\n, (45)\nwhere T\u0000 is equilibrium temperature of the photon bath. Note that this only requires the dif-\n12\nferent components to haveequilibrium distributions (which are what determine the densities\nand pressures) at temperaturesTi:t h e c o m p o n e n t s d o n \u2019 t a c t u a l l y n e e d t o m a i n t a i n s t r o n g\nself-interactions such that they are in equilibrium with each other (in which case one would\nhave Ti = T\u0000). As long as an equilibrium distribution is maintained after they go out of\nthermal equilibrium (as we will discuss next), and that they are relativistic, they contribute\nsigni\ufb01cantly to the energy density in the early radiation dominated phase of the universe.\nAs the temperature decreases, the e\u21b5ective number of degrees of freedom in radiation will\ndecrease, as massive particles start behaving non-relativistically whenkBT drops below their\nrest mass-energy. In Fig. 2 we show a numerical calculation of the full evolution ofg?,w h i c h\nis based on the properties of particles in the standard model, which are listed in Table 3.\nWe brie\ufb02y discuss a few regimes of interest:\n\u2022 kBT \u2327 1M e V :t h eo n l yr e l a t i v i s t i cp a r t i c l e sw o u l db et h e3n e u t r i n os p e c i e sa n dt h e\ncorresponding anti-neutrinos3 (fermions, 1 degree of freedom each) and the photons\n(boson, 2 polarization states). Neutrinos at these energies are decoupled from the\nthermal bath (see\u00a7 4), but maintain a thermal distribution at a slightly lower temper-\nature than the photons, withT\u232b =( 4/11)1/3T\u0000 (we will derive this in detail shortly).\nTherefore:\ng? =2|{z}\nphotons\n+\nneutrinos/anti-neutrinos\nz }| {\n7\n8\n\"\n(3 + 3)\u21e5\n\u2713 4\n11\n\u25c64/3#\n' 3.36 .

As the di\u21b5erence between neutrino and photon\ntemperature is due to electron-positron annihilation which occurs at later times (see\ndiscussion in\u00a7 4), we haveT\u232b = T\u0000 and so\ng? =2|{z}\nphotons\n+\nneutrinos/antineutrinos\nz }| {\n7\n8 (3 + 3) + 7\n8 (2 + 2)\n| {z }\nelectrons/positrons\n=1 0.75 (47)\n\u2022 T> 300 GeV: this is above the electroweak uni\ufb01cation scale, and for the particles in\nthe Standard Model we haveg\u21e4 ' 106.75.4\n3Whether or not anti-neutrinos exist depends on whether neutrinos have aMajorana mass or a Dirac\nmass. Anti-neutrinos exist in the latter scenario, whereas in the former scenario neutrinos are their own\nanti-particle like photons. See the Aside on neutrinos in \u00a7 3.1.2 of Baumann\u2019s book for more details.\nSince the total number of degrees of freedom needs to be the same in both of these scenarios to satisfy Big\nBang Nucleosynthesis, we will just refer to the anti-neutrino (i.e. Dirac mass) case for concreteness.\n4If there are additional new particles,g? could increase further.\n13\nFigure 2: The full evolution of the e\u21b5ective degrees of freedomg? with temperature for the standard model.\nThe masses on the top axes indicate a few speci\ufb01c masses of particles in the standard model; at temperatures\nhigher than the mass they are approximately in equilibrium, below the mass they annihilate. The QCD phase\ntransition is more complicated, and the evolution cannot be evaluated analytically in that regime (at higher\ntemperatures the evolution also has non-trivial corrections and may not asymptote to the full thermal result\nof 106.75). The value today,g? =3 .38, is the analytic result (3.36) plus a small correction because neutrino\ndecoupling ande\u0000 \u0000e+ annihilation overlap slightly, slightly heating the neutrinos to a higher temperature\nthan (4/11)T\u0000. The valueg? = 86.25 is what\u2019s you\u2019d expect for everything exceptW+,W \u0000,Z 0, Higgs (which\nall have m \u0000 mW ) and the top quark being in equilibrium, which does not accurately match the plateau\nbecause of non-trivial QCD and electroweak e\u21b5ects. Figure from Antony Lewis\u2019 notes.\n3.7 Distribution of Decoupled Species \u2013 An Example: the CMB\nWe can now apply what we have learned so far to the CMB. First consider the following\nquestion: why is the CMB observed to be a perfect black body radiation \ufb01eld today? Recall\nthat a black body radiation \ufb01eld is what results when radiation and matter are in thermal\nequilibrium with each other. At present, the radiation and matter in the universe are wildly\nout of equilbrium with each other. Indeed, most of the baryons are in the form of ionized\ngas in the IGM at temperatureT \u21e0 104 but the CMB is atT =2 .73 K. So what gives, why\nshould the CMB be a perfect black body today?\nThe answer of course is that the radiation and matter were in thermal equilibrium in the past\ndue to Thompson scattering of photons with electrons and at this time the radiation \ufb01eld\nwas a black body. This equilibrium was maintained until some timetf , which we will refer to\nas the time of ofphoton decouplingwhich is closely related to (but not exactly the same)\nas last scattering.T h e p h o t o n s d e c o u p l e f r o m t h e m a t t e r b e c a u s e d u r i n grecombination\nthe formation of the \ufb01rst atoms rapidly decreases the electron density causing the opacity to\nsuddenly drop. After this timetf ,t h ec o n d i t i o n\u0000\u0000 H is violated (where \u0000 is the Thompson\nscattering rate), the universe becomes transparent to Thompson scattering, and the photons\ndecouple from the matter. The CMB is thus a relic radiation \ufb01eld, and the black body that\nis frozen in is a vestige of the timest<t f when it was in thermal equilibrium. Let\u2019s now\n14\nphotonaaoy\nFigure 3: The standard model particles, with their mass, spin and degeneraciesgs.

Hence the\nfactors [a(tf )/a(t)]3,w h i c ha r i s ef r o mt h ed i l u t i o no fp h o t o n sd u et oc o s m i ce x p a n s i o n . W e\ncan relate \u232b0 at t = tf to \u232b at time t by noting that aftertf photons simply redshift away\ntheir energy, such that\u232b = \u232b0a(tf )/a(t) ! \u232b0 = \u232ba(t)/a(tf ). So we \ufb01nd\nn(\u232b, t)d\u232b =\n\uf8ffa(tf )\na(t)\n\u00003\nn[\u232ba(t)/a(tf ),t f ]d[\u232ba(t)/a(tf )]. (51)\nWe thus see that the ratio of scale factorsa(t)/a(tf )a l lc a n c e le x c e p ti nt h ee x p o n e n t i a l ,s o\nthat the number density at timet is given by\nn(\u232b, t)d\u232b = 8\u21e1\nc3\n\u232b2d\u232b\neh\u232b/kBT(t) \u0000 1; T(t)= T(tf )a(tf )/a(t). (52)\nThus the distribution of photon energies retains the black-body form even afer the photons\nwent out of equilbrium with matter, but with a temperature that decreases with time as\nT / a\u00001.\nIn general, if some particle speciesi dropped out of thermal equilibrium with (decoupled\nfrom) the hot plasma at some timetf , its temperature at that time is approximately equal\nto the photon temperature at that timeTf \u2318 T\u0000(tf ), where hot plasma refers now to all\nrelativistic species including photons which we indicate asT\u0000 (or sometimes justT). After\ndecoupling, the mean interaction rate \u0000 of the particle drops below the expansion rateH,\nand the particle moves on a geodesic. As we have seen the momentum of a particle scales as\np / a\u00001 due to Hubble drag, which is valid for both relativistcic and non-relativistic species.\nSince the relative momenta are conserved as we\u2019ve just seen for the example of the CMB,\n16\nLocaltend equilibrium\nof\n0 va\u00e1\nthe actual distribution function att>t f can be written as\nf(p, t)= f(p a(t)\na(tf ),t f ). (53)\nIn other words, the form of the distribution function is \u2018frozen-in\u2019 the moment the particles\ndecouple from the hot plasma, and the only thing that evolves with time is the temperature\nof that distributionTi.\nIf a species is still relativistic after decoupling such thatE = pc,t h e nw eh a v e\nf(p, t)= g\n2\u21e1~3\n\u21e2\nexp\n\uf8ff pc\nkBTi\n\u0000\n\u00b1 1\n\u0000\u00001\n; Ti(t)= Tf\na(tf )\na(t) . (54)\nThus, as we\u2019ve just seen for the CMB, the distribution of a decoupled, relativistic species is\nself-similar to that of a relativistic species in thermal equilibrium, but with a temperature\nTi(t). Note that this does not necessarily equal to the temperature of the hot plasma at this\nlater timet,a sw es h a l ls e ei nam o m e n t .\nIf the species is already non-relativistic when it decouples, its energy is given byE = mc2+p2/\n2m,a n ds i n c ekBT \u2327 mc2 we can ignore the\u00b11t e r ms ot h a tt h ed i s t r i b u t i o nf u n c t i o ni s\nMaxwell-Boltzmann\nf(p) \u21e1 e\u0000E(p)/kBT .

Note however that because of the di\u21b5erentp2\ndependence in the exponential, and thep / a\u00001 dependence, this implies that the tempera-\nture of this decoupled distribution scales di\u21b5erently as\nTi = Tf\n\uf8ffa(tf )\na(t)\n\u00002\n.

As we\nwill see, in cosmology entropy is more informative than energy. It is easy to show that the\nentropy is conserved in LTE, as you showed on the homework.\nAccording to the second law of thermodynamics, the total entropy of the universe only\nincreases or stays constant. Since there are far more photons than baryons in the universe,\nthe entropy of the universe is dominated by the entropy of the photon bath (at least as long\nas the universe is su\u0000ciently uniform). Any entropy production from irreversible processes\nis therefore totally insigni\ufb01cant relative to the total entropy. To a good approximation, we\ncan therefore treat the expansion of the universe as adiabatic, so that the total entropy of\nthe universe stays constant even if di\u21b5erent particles species have dropped out of equilibrium\nat various times.\nThe entropy density is de\ufb01ned by\ns \u2318 S\nV , (59)\nand you demonstrated in the homework that this is a conserved quantity, i.e.\nsa3 =c o n s t a n t. (60)\nWe brie\ufb02y review how this is derived. The \ufb01rst lawof thermodynamcs can be written\ndS(V,T )= 1\nT (dU + PdV )= 1\nT {d [\u21e2(T)V ]+ P(T)dV } . (61)\nIn general the di\u21b5erential ofS can be written\ndS(V,T )= @S\n@V dV + @S\n@T dT. (62)\nReading o\u21b5 the partial derivatives by comparing eqns. (61) and (62), and applying the\nintergrability condition\n@2S\n@V @T = @2S\n@T@V , (63)\nyields\ndP\ndT = \u21e2(T)+ P(T)\nT . (64)\nNow rewriting the \ufb01rst law as\ndS = 1\nT (\u21e2dV + Vd \u21e2+ PdV )= 1\nT (\u21e2dV + Vd \u21e2+ PdV + Vd P\u0000 Vd P)\n= 1\nT d [(\u21e2 + P) V ] \u0000 V\nT2 (\u21e2 + P) dT\n= d\n\uf8ff(\u21e2 + P)V\nT\n\u0000\n, (65)\n18\nwhere the second line used eqn. (64). Since the entropy must be stationary in LTE,dS =0 ,\nthis then implies\nS = (\u21e2 + P)V\nT +c o n s t a n t. (66)\nSince the total entropy should be an extensive quantityS / V , we can choose this constant\nto be zero. Thus the entropy density iss = S/V\ns = \u21e2 + P\nT . (67)\nNow what about the time evolution ofs.W e l l w e k n o w t h a t i n L T E t h e e n t r o p y i s s t a t i o n a r y\ndS =0 .

(72)\nNotice that g?S is equal to g? in eqn. (45) only when all the relativistic species are in\nequilibrium at the same temperature. From now on we will simly take T = T\u0000 as the\ntemperature of the universe.\nConservation of entropy has several important consequences, which we know brie\ufb02y discuss.\n\u2022 Scaling ofT with scale factora With our de\ufb01nition ofg?S conservation of entropy\ncan be written:\ng?S(T)T3a3 =c o n s t) T / g\u00001/3\n?S (T)a\u00001, (73)\n19\nwhich follows simply fromsa3 =c o n s t( c o n s e r v a t i o no fe n t r o p y )a n dt h ed e \ufb01 n i t i o no f\ng?S(T)a b o v e . A tt e m p e r a t u r e sa w a yf r o mp a r t i c l em a s st h r e s h o l d st h r e s h o l d sg?S(T)\nis approximately constant and thusT / a\u00001 as we expect for radiation. The factor of\ng\u00001/3\n?S (T) accounts for the fact that whenever a particle species becomes non-relativistic\n(freezes out) and disappears, its entropy is transferred to the other relativistic species\nstill present in the thermal plasma, causingT to thus descrease slightly less slowly\nthan a\u00001 (sometimes this is called \u201cheating\u201d). We will see an example of this in the\nnext section.\n\u2022 Entropy is a useful reference quantity for number densities:Becase s / a\u00003,\nthe number of particles in a comoving volume is therefore proportional to the number\ndensity ni divided by the total entropy density\nNi \u2318 ni\ns . (74)\nIf particles are neither produced nor destroyed, thenni / a\u00003,a n dNi is constant.\nThis is very useful when we describe decoupled relics which are frozen in. The point\nis that because the number of degrees of freedomg? could be changing throughout\nthe radiation dominated phase (see Fig. 2) the expansion history, the temperature\nevolution, and the total number of photons are not simple functions ofa or time, and\nnot that easy to relate to the number of CMB photons today (which we know well).\nThe equation above says thatNi is the number of particles per unit total entropy,\nand if particles are conserved (say after decoupling) since total entropy is conserved,\nit is then trivial to determine the number density of relics at timet = t0,b ys i m p l y\nmultiplying the present day value of the entropy densitys0 by Ni. Another example\nis the total baryon number. I can computenB,0/s0 today and this has to be equal to\nthe total baryon number just after the epoch of baryogenesisnB/s =( nb \u0000n\u00afb)/s (since\nbaryons don\u2019t decay away).\n\u2022 Relativistic (hot) relics are comparable in number to CMB photons:\nFinally, we saw earlier (eqn. 58) that for any decoupled species we can write,\nn(t)=\n\uf8ffa(tf )\na(t)\n\u00003\nneq(tf ). (75)\nIf the species is relativistic when it decouples its number density is, from eqn. (36),\nn = g(kBT)3\u21e3(3)\n\u21e12~3c3\n\u21e2 1b o s o n s\n3\n4 fermions . (76)\nFor the moment absorb the factor of 1 or 3/4i n t os o m ege\u21b5 where ge\u21b5 = g for bosons\nand ge\u21b5 =( 3/4)g for fermions, whereg is here the degeneracy factor of the decoupled\nspecies. Then we can compare the number density of a relativistically decoupled species\n20\n__\nto that of the CMB photonsnCMB at some later timet>t f\nn(t)\nnCMB(t) = neq(tf)\nnCMB(t)\n\uf8ffa(tf )\na(t)\n\u00003\n= ge\u21b5\ng\u0000\n\u2713Tf\nT\n\u25c63 \uf8ffa(tf )\na(t)\n\u00003\n, (77)\nwhere T = T(t)i st h et e m p e r a t u r eo ft h ep h o t o n sa n dg\u0000 =2i st h ed e g e n e r a c yf a c t o r\nfor photons.

(78)\nPlugging this in above \ufb01nally gives\nn(t)\nnCMB(t) = ge\u21b5\n2\ng?S(T)\ng?S(Tf ). (79)\nThis illustrates that the number density of any relic background of relativistic particles\nis comparable to the number density of CMB photons. Note that this equation also\nremains valid even if the particles later become non-relativistic (by redshifting away\ntheir energy and momentum) such thatkBT(tNR) \u21e0 mc2 some time after decoupling\nwhere tNR >t f .\n4 Neutrino Decoupling\nNeutrinos are fermions (spin 1/2p a r t i c l e s )t h a ti n t e r a c to n l yv i at h ew e a kf o r c ea n dg r a v i t y .\nThey are electrically neutral and have a massm\u232bc2 . 0.1e V ( i . e .. 2 \u21e5 10\u00007 times smaller\nthan the electron) such that they will esentially always be relativistic. There areN\u232b three\n\ufb02avors of neutrinos: electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos, and tau neutrinos, although only\nthe electron neutrinos take part in electromagnetic interactions. Since neutrinos are spin 1/2\nfermions we expect their degeneracy factorg to be g\u232b = 2. However, only one of these spin\nstates, so calledleft-handed or active neutrinos have ever been observed, so we will assume\ng\u232b = 1. Neutrinos with the other spin-state are calledright-handed or sterile neutrinos,\nwhich are hypothetical particles which are postulated to interact only via gravity but not via\nthe fundamental interactions of the Standard Model. Sterile neutrinos have been advocated\nas possible candidates for the dark matter. In what follows we focus on the active neutrinos\nwhich decoupled around 1s after the Big Bang and calculate the temperature of the cosmic\nneutrino background, which we argued previously has a temperatureT\u232b =\n\u0000 4\n11\n\u0000\nTCMB.\nNeutrinos maintain thermal equilibrium with the primordial plasma through interactions\n21\nFigure 4: Thermal history through electron-positron annihilation.

Whereas, what we desire is a relationship between two temperatures,\nthe decoupled neutrino temperatureT\u232b and the temperature of the CMB. Note that sincea2\nis after electron-positron annihilation, and neutrino decoupling, only the two photon degrees\nof freedom occupy the so-called thermal bath, in other words, we just have a thermal bath of\nphotons (coupled to baryons and leptons, but recall that non-relativistic particles contribute\nno signi\ufb01cant energy or entropy) and decoupled neutrinos (which travel along geodesics).\nAfter this point the photon temperatureT\u0000(a) / a\u00001 all the way up to the present epoch\nsince there will be no further changes in the number of relativistic degrees of freedom, i.e.\nT\u00002 is just the CMB temperature ata2.B u t b y t h e s a m e r e a s o n i n g ,T\u00002 6=( a1/a2)T\u00001 (e.g.\nsee Fig. 4).\nSo in order to eliminateT\u00001 we need to use the fact that the neutrinos are just traveling\nalong geodesics and not interacting with anything anymore. This means that their energy\nis simply being redshifted away by Hubble drag, i.e.T\u232b / a since the timea1 at which they\nwere in thermal equilibrium. An equivalent way to state exactly the same thing is to say\n24\n\u02c7\nthat their entropy isseparately conservedsince they decoupled, that is\ns\u232b / T3\n\u232b and s\u232ba3 =c o n s t) T\u232b / a\u00001, (91)\nwhich implies\nT\u232b = a1\na2\nT\u00001, (92)\nUsing this in eqn.

The expression above remarkably\ndoes not depend onN\u232b or g\u232b (although the energy density does). Plugging in numbers we\n\ufb01nd that forT\u00000 =2 .725 K, we getT\u232b0 =1 .945 K.\nUsing the expressions for energy density in eqn.

We have either\nassumed LTE, or as in the case of neutrino decoupling, used entropy conservation to relate\ndi\u21b5erent times in the universe\u2019s thermal history where some departure from LTE ocurred.\nBut in order to treat other fundamental issues in the Universe\u2019s thermal history like: the\npossibility of dark matter being athermal relic, the recombination of electrons with protons\nat decoupling, and the synthesis of the light elements, we need to be able to understand\ndepartures from equilibrium. The formal tool to describe the evolution beyond equilibrium\nis the Boltzmann equation, which appears extraordinarily simple although solutions can be\nincredibly complicated. For some species of particlei it reads\ndfi\ndt = Ci[f]. (96)\nHere fi is the one-particle distribution function andCi[f]i st h ec o l l i s i o n a lt e r m5 that depends\non fi,a sw e l la sa l lo t h e rd i s t r i b u t i o nf u n c t i o n sfj which particle i can interact with.

But note thatx and p are themselves functions of time\nbecause of the particle motion. Thus the time derivative that we wrote above is actually a\n\u201cconvective derivative\u201d analogous to in \ufb02uid mechanics, and it actually becomes\ndfi\ndt = @fi\n@t + dx\ndt \u00b7r xfi + dp\ndt \u00b7r pfi. (97)\nIn the current cosmological context, we can simplify this derivative in a few ways. First\nnote that by homogeneityrxfi =0 ,a sw ea r g u e dp r e v i o u s l yw h e nd i s c u s s i n ge q u i l i b r i u m\ndistribution functions. Furthermore,\ndpk\ndt = dpk\nda \u02d9a = \u0000Hpk, (98)\nwhere the last equality used the fact that Hubble drag impliesp / a\u00001,a n dh e n c e\ndpk\nda = \u0000pk\na . (99)\nThus the Boltzmann equation simpli\ufb01es to\ndfi\ndt = @fi\n@t \u0000 Hp \u00b7r pfi = Ci[f]. (100)\nNow we can integrate the equation above over mometnum space\nR\nd3p/(2\u21e1~)3,a l s ok n o w n\nas taking the \u2018zeroth moment\u2019, to obtain an expression for the number densityni\ndni\ndt +3 Hni =\nZ d3p\n(2\u21e1~)3 Ci[f], (101)\nwhere the \ufb01rst term on the left-hand side is obvious6, the second term on the left is less\nobvious but obtainable by integrating by parts7,a n dt h er i g h th a n ds i d ei ss o m ev e r yd i \u0000 c u l t\nthing to calculate depending on the set of particle interactions you are dealing with.\nThis form of the Boltzman equation in terms ofni for a homogenous and isotropic universe\n6You may have noticed that there is a missing degeneracy factorgi here. Just assume we have incorporated\nthat into the distribution functionfi\n7This is relatively straightforward to show, i.e. you get terms like\nR\ndp4\u21e1p3d f/dp, and uv part of the\nintegration by parts vanishes provided thatf(p) ! 0 as p !1 as any well-behaved distribution function\nshould.\n26\nbecomes even more intuitive if we write it as\n1\na3\nd(nia3)\ndt =\nZ d3p\n(2\u21e1~)3 Ci[f] \u2318 C0\ni[nj]. (102)\nIn this form it lends itself to an intuitive interpretation. In the absence of collisionsC0 =0 ,\nthe Boltzman equation indicates thatnia3 is a conserved quantity. Since n represents a\nphysical (proper) number density, this states that the universal Hubble expansion causes\nthe volume of a region containing a \ufb01xed number of particles to grow asa3,a n dh e n c et h e\nphysical number density of these particles falls o\u21b5 asa\u00003.E q u i v a l e n t l y w e c a n s a y t h a t i n\nthe absence of collisions the comoving number densityN = na3 is conserved. Sometimes\nwe will describe this collisionless scenario by saying that the particles are \u201ctraveling along\ngeodesics\u201d, or \u201cexpanding with the Hubble \ufb02ow\u201d. The collisions with other particlesnj,\nencapsulated in the collision termC0\ni[nj], causes departures from these geodesics. Let us\nnow consider the impact of these collisions.\nBecause interactions between three or more particles are very unlikely, for concreteness let us\nfocus our attention on the number densityn1 of a single particle species 1, and that the only\nprocess a\u21b5ecting the abundance of this species is an annihilation with species 2, producing\ntwo particles, which we will call 3 and 4. Similarly the inverse process can also occur: 3 and\n4 can also combine to produce particles 1 and 2. We can represent this reaction as\n1+2 $ 3+4 . (103)\nClearly the rate of change in the abundance of species 1 is given by the di\u21b5erence betweeen\nthe rates for producing and eliminating the species. For this simple case the collision term\nsimpli\ufb01es and we can write the Boltzmann equation as8\n1\na3\nd(n1a3)\ndt = \u0000\u21b5(T)n1n2 + \u0000(T)n3n4. (104)\nThe right hand side can be understood as follows. The \ufb01rst term,\u0000\u21b5n1n2,d e s c r i b e st h e\nrate of destruction of species 1, whereas the second term,\u0000n3n4 describes its creation rate\nwhen 3 and 4 come together. It is intuitive that the destruction rate is proportional ton1\nand n2 and the creation rate proportional ton3 and n4.T h e p a r a m e t e r\u21b5(T)c a nb ew r i t t e n\nas\n\u21b5(T) \u2318h \u0000vi, (105)\nwhere \u0000 is the interaction cross-section for the 1\u0000 2a n n i h i l a t i o nr e a c t i o nt h a tp r o d u c e s\n3 \u0000 4p a r t i c l e s ,a n dv is the relative velocity between the projectile particles 1 and the\ntarget particles 2. The angle brackets indicate that we are using the appropriate velocity\n8This equation is actually an approximation. See Dodelson\u00a7 3.1, Piatella\u00a7 3.8, or Kolb and Turner\u00a7 5.1\nfor the details of what is actually being assumed here. We are essentially assuming that all the reactants\nhave a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and are coupled to the thermal bathT. For example if the reaction\nwas \u232b +\u00af\u232b $ e+ +e\u0000, then the charge of the electrons and positrons and electromagnetic interactions enforce\nkinetic equilibrium between them and the thermal bath. The Maxwell-Boltzmann assumption is equivalent\nto saying the occupation numbers of all the particle species are low, i.e. we are neglecting Fermi-blocking\nand Bose-enhancement e\u21b5ects.\n27\ndistribution averaged cross-section, and it is intuitive that this should be a function of the\ntemperature of the thermal bathT.\nNow we can relate\u21b5(T)t o \u0000(T) by noting that if the system were in thermal equilibrium,\nthe left hand side of the Boltzmann equation would have to be zero. This is a common\ntrick in statistical mechanics where you hypothetically take the system to thermodynamic\nequilibrium to determine the relationship between forward and backward reaction rates.\nSpeci\ufb01cally it allows you to express the ratio of forward and backward reaction rates as\nratios of equilibrium number densities. In this other context it goes by the name of thelaw\nof mass actionand the principle ofdetailed balance. The beauty of this trick is that\neven though we are discussing a non-equilibrium situation, we can still obtain a realtionship\nbetween forward and backward rates, by insisting that they be equal in equilibrium.\nApplying this argument to the case at hand we \ufb01nd that the relationship between\u0000(T)a n d\n\u21b5(T)= h\u0000vi must be\n\u0000 = n0\n1n0\n2\nn0\n3n0\n4\nh\u0000vi, (106)\nwhere n0\ni are the number densities in thermal equilibrium which we calculated previously.\nThus we can recast the Boltzmann equation as\n1\na3\nd(n1a3)\ndt = \u0000h\u0000vin1n2\n\uf8ff\n1 \u0000\n\u2713n3n4\nn1n2\n\u25c6\u0000\u2713n0\n3n0\n4\nn0\n1n0\n2\n\u25c6\u0000\n. (107)\n6 Dark Matter and Thermal Relics\nWe will now discuss the idea that dark matter could be a thermal relic of the Hot Big Bang.\nThe idea here is that at some point in the Universe\u2019s thermal history dark matter was in\nthermal equilibrium with particles from the standard model which make up the photon bath,\nand that it satis\ufb01ed \u0000\u0000 H. As the universe expanded and cooled this reaction eventually\nfreezes out when \u0000 \u21e0 H, and we are left with arelic abundance of cold dark matter\nparticles. If we can calculate this abundance, we can put constraints on the cross-section\nand mass of the dark matter particles by requiring that this abundance match the amount\nof cold dark matter in the universe determined from cosmological observations. This topic is\nobviously speculative because it requires that we make assumptions about the physical nature\nof the unknown dark matter particles. For concreteness, we will focus on the hypothesis that\ndark matter is composed ofweakly interacting massive particles(WIMPs).\nConsider the following process\nX + \u00afX $ l + \u00afl, (108)\nwhere X represents the dark matter particle andl is a lepton.

(113)\nFinally, note that if we consider times when the number of degrees of freedom are not\nchanging, thena / 1/T, we can also equivalently adopt a new time coordinate that highlights\nwhen interesting things are expected to happen, namely when the dark matter particle of\nmass m transitions from being relativistic to non-relativistic. For this calculation we are\nmost interested in cold dark matter, which is to say acold thermal relicthat decouples\nfrom the photon bath when it is non-relativistic, although in the homework you will consider\na hot thermal relic,w h i c hi sas p e c i e st h a td e c o u p l e sw h e ni ti ss t i l lr e l a t i v i s t i c . W e\nknow that the number density of a particle will be exponentially suppressed when it goes\nnon-relativistic, resulting in a similar suppression of \u0000, and ultimately decoupling.\nThis motivates us to de\ufb01ne\nx \u2318 mc2\nkBT , (114)\nwhere m is the mass of the dark matter particle.

You will see all variants of this rescaling in cosmology books,\nand we will switch to scaling by the entropy in just a moment. This form of the Boltzmann\n29\n\u2f00\nequation for thermal relics has no analytic solution, and must be solved numerically which\nwe will come to next, but \ufb01rst we discuss its qualitative behavior.\nAk e yp a r a m e t e rg o v e r n i n gt h ee v o l u t i o no fe q n .( 1 1 5 )i s\u0000/H.T h e r e a r e a f e w i n t e r e s t i n g\nregimes:\n\u0000 \u0000 H:F o r \u0000\u0000 H the natural state of the system is to approach the chemical equilibrium\nsolution N0\nX.F o r e x a m p l e i f w e s t a r t o u tNX \u0000 N0\nX the right-hand side will be a large\nnegative number, quickly drivingNX !

(120)\nFig. 5 provides a schematic illustration of particle freeze-out.\n31\nLet\u2019s now do a more quantitative analysis to con\ufb01rm this qualitative description and estimate\nthe mass density in a cold thermal relic. As we mentioned in\u00a7 3.8, it is often advantageous\nto work with the ratio of number density to entropy density owing to the fact that the total\nentropy of the universe is conserved. Recall that the total entropy density can be written\ns = 2\u21e12\n45~3c3 g?S(T)(kBT)3. (121)\nWe thus de\ufb01ne the following quantities\nY \u2318 nX\ns ,Y eq \u2318 n0\nX\ns , (122)\nallowing us to write the Boltzmann equation as\ndY\ndt = \u0000sh\u0000vi\n\u21e5\nY 2 \u0000 Y 2\neq\n\u21e4\n(123)\nAgain, since most of the interesting dynamics will take place whenkBT \u21e0 mc2 we adopt the\nmore convenient time coordinatex \u2318 mc2/kBT.T o r e w r i t e t h e t i m e d e r i v a t i v e i n t e r m s o f\nx we note that\ndx\ndt = d\ndt\n\u2713mc2\nkBT\n\u25c6\n= \u0000x\nT\ndT\ndt ' Hx, (124)\nwhere we have assumed thatT / a\u00001.R e c a l lt h a ti ng e n e r a lT3a3g?S(T)=c o n s t ,s ow ea r e\nassuming that no major changes in the number of degrees of freedom occur over the times\nrelevant to this particle freeze-out so that we can writeg?S \u21e1 const \u2318 g?S(m). Since we are\nassuming that we are deep in the radiation dominated era recall thatH2 / a\u00004 and hence\nH / a\u00002 / T2 / x\u00002 so we can write\nH = H(m)\nx2 , (125)\nwhere H(m)= H(x = 1) is the Hubble parameter corresponding to a thermal energy\nkBT = mc2.W et h e n\ufb01 n a l l ya r r i v ea tt h es o - c a l l e dRiccati equation,\ndY\ndx = \u0000 \u0000\nx2\n\u21e5\nY 2 \u0000 Y 2\neq\n\u21e4\n, (126)\nwhere\n\u0000 \u2318 2\u21e12(mc2)3h\u0000vig?S(m)\n45H(m)~3c3 . (127)\nIn this case chemical equilibrium would simply implyY = Yeq and from eqn.

The departure from equilibriumY = Yeq implied by\nthe Boltzmann equation solution is what we described asfreeze-out and, as we discussed,\nit takes place approximately when \u0000\u21e0 H.\n32\nFigure 6: Abundance of dark matter particles as the temperature drops below the mass, i.e.\nx = mc2\nkBT . Figure from Baumann.\nA numerical solution to eqn. (126) is shown in Fig. 6. In practical terms this is done by\nchoosing a small initial value ofx = xi and initalizing Y (xi)= Yeq(xi)a n d\ufb01 x i n g\u0000 to be\na constant. Notice that \u0000 parameterizes the interaction rate. One sees that the freeze-\nout abundance Y1 decreases as \u0000 increases. This makes intuitive sense: larger interaction\nrates maintain equilibrium longer and \u0000\u21e0 H occurs deeper into the Boltzmann-suppressed\nregime, resulting in a lower overall relic abundance.\nFrom inspection of Fig. 6 one observes also that the freeze-out, i.e. when the abundance\nY departs from Yeq,o c c u r sa r o u n dav a l u eo fxf ' 10.

For x>x f,w ek n o wt h a tYeq drops rapidly to zero, and the Boltzmann equation\ncan be written dY\ndx \u21e1\u0000 \u0000\nx2 Y 2;( x>x f).

(130)\nAfter freeze-out whenY has attained Y1 the number of dark matter particles per unit of\nentropy is \ufb01xed (recall the discussion in\u00a7 3.8, that this is a conserved quantity if the dark\nmatter particle number does not change after freeze-out). We can now write down the\npresent day energy density in dark matter as follows:\n\u21e2X0 = nX0m = mY1s0, (131)\nwhere\ns0 = 2\u21e12\n45~3c3 g?S(T0)(kBT0)3 (132)\nis the present day entropy density. Or expressing this relative to the critical density we have\n\u2326X0 = \u21e2X0\n\u21e2crit,0\n= mxf\n\u0000\ns0\n\u21e2crit,0\n, (133)\nwhere we used eqn. (130). Combining eqn.

The Planck satellite has made a\npercent level measurement of the density in cold dark matter \u2326CDMh2 =0 .1200\u00b10.0012. The\nfact that a cross-section with an order of magnitude characteristic of the weak interaction\nG2\nF \u21e0 10\u000010 GeV\u00002 gives the right order of magnitude for the cold dark matter abundance\nis what is known as theWIMP miracle.\n35\nPhys 236: Cosmology\nLecture 8: Recombination and Decoupling\nAn important event in the history of the early Universe is the formation of the \ufb01rst atoms.\nAt temperatures above about 1 eV, the universe still consisted of a plasma of free electrons\nand nuclei. Photons were tightly coupled to the electrons via Compton scattering, which in\nturn strongly interacted with protons via Coulomb scattering. There was very little neutral\nhydrogen. When the temperature became low enough, the electrons and nuclei combined to\nform neutral atoms, and the density of free electrons fell sharply. This event which formed\nthe \ufb01rst atoms in the Universe is known asrecombination. As the electrons disappear onto\natoms the scattering rate \u0000 of photons o\u21b5 of electrons drops below the expansion rate and the\nphotons decouple from the matter and the universe becomes transparent, which is known as\ndecoupling. Today, these photons are observed as the cosmic microwave background, and\nthe fact that decoupling happened so abruptly explains why we appear to see CMB photons\norginating from a surface known as thelast scattering surface, as shown in Fig. 1\nFigure 1: An observer is surrounded by a spherical last scattering surface. The photons of\nthe CMB travel straight to us from the last scattering surface, being continuously redshifted.\nThe distance back to the last scattering surface atz ' 1100 is almost equal to our particle\nhorizon. Figure taken from Ryden.\n1\nFor these two events, recombination and decoupling, the relevant interactions are:\np + e\u0000 $ H+ \u0000,\ne\u0000 + \u0000 $ e\u0000 + \u0000. (1)\nDecoupling occurs just after recombination for the obvious reason that it is the disapearance\nof the electrons onto atoms that causes the Thompson scattering rate to plummett thus\nfreeing the photons from the plasma.\n1 Recombination\n1.1 Baryon to Photon Ratio\nPreviously we noted that if the particle number is not changing, then becausen / a\u00003 and\ns / a\u00003,t h e i rr a t i o ,t h en u m b e ro fp a r t i c l e sp e ru n i te n t r o p y ,\nNi = ni\ns (2)\nis a conserved quantity which behaves like a comoving number density provided that particles\nare not being created or destroyed anymore. A useful application of this is to the number of\nbaryons. Provided that baryon number nonconserving interactions (if they even exist) are\noccuring very slowly then\nnB/s =( nB \u0000 n\u00afB)/s, (3)\nand so this ratio is a constant since the epoch of baryogenesis when the baryon assymmetry\nwas put in place.\nThe ratio of baryons to entropy is related to an important quantity that we will use in studies\nof both recombination and Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), which is the baryon to photon\nratio\n\u2318 = nB\nn\u0000\n(4)\nRecall that\ns = 2\u21e12\n45~3c3 g?S(T)(kBT)3 and n\u0000 = 2(kBT)3\u21e3(3)\n\u21e12~3c3 , (5)\nwhich implies\ns =1 .80g?S(T)n\u0000.

However, we know that sincee+ \u0000e\u0000 annihilation at around\nT \u21e0 500 keV, or about 4s after the Big Bang, the number of degrees of freedom has not\n2\nchanged and\ng?S(T . 500 keV) =\nphotons\nz}|{\n2+ 7\n8N\u232b(2g\u232b)\n\u2713T\u232b\nT\n\u25c63\n| {z }\nneutrinos/anti-neutrinos\n=2+ 7\n4 \u00b7 3 \u00b7 1 \u00b7 4\n11 =3 .91, (8)\nso we \ufb01nd that\n\u2318 ' 7nB\ns (9)\nis also a conserved quantity since that time.\nWe can calculate\u2318 as follows. Recalling that\n\u21e2\u00000 = 2(kBT0)4\u21e12\n30~3c3 , (10)\nwe use eqn. (5) above to write\nn\u00000\n\u21e2\u00000\n= 30\u21e3(3)\n\u21e14kBT0\n, (11)\nand therefore\n\u2318 = nB0\nn\u00000\n= \u21e2B0\nmpc2n\u00000\n= \u21e14kBT0\u21e2B0\n30\u21e3(3)mpc2\u21e2\u00000\n= \u21e14kBT0\u2326B0\n30\u21e3(3)mpc2\u2326\u00000\n=5 .5 \u21e5 10\u000010\n\u2713\u2326B0h2\n0.020\n\u25c6\n.

The \ufb01rst is the destruction of hydrogen atoms via\nthe photoelectric e\u21b5ect\nH+ \u0000 ! p + e\u0000, (13)\nwhich can occur if the photon\u0000 has an energyh\u232b > 13.6e V\u2318 BH.T h i s r e a c t i o n c a n a l s o\nrun in the opposite direction which is known asradiative recombination\np + e\u0000 ! H+ \u0000. (14)\nWhen does the recombination phase transition, and the consequent decoupling of photons\ntake place? We can obtain a quick and dirty estimate of the recombination temperature.\nOne might argue that recombination must take place when the mean energy per photon in\nthe cosmic microwave background falls below the ionization potential of the hydrogen atom,\nBH =1 3.6 eV. When this happens the average CMB photon is no longer able to photoionize\nhydrogen. Since the mean photon energy for a black body distribution isE ' 2.7kBT,t h i s\n3 o 02\nnaive argument would suggest a recombination temperature of\nTrec \u21e0 BH\n2.7kB\n\u21e0 60, 000 K) zrec \u21e0 20, 000. (15)\nBut we know the surface of last scattering is aroundzdec \u21e0 1100, so what did we do wrong\nhere? Obviously we ignored the fact that photons are not just at the mean temperature, but\nhave a distribution functinof(p). More importantly, this calculation neglects that photons\noutnumber baryons by a gigantic factor, namely\u2318\u00001 \u21e0 2\u21e5109.T h u s a n y n e w l y f o r m e d a t o m\nwill be surrounded by over a billion photons, and it is thus not the mean energy of those\nphotons that matters, but whether a photon in the extreme tail of the distribution is still\nenergetic enough to ionize hydrogen. Apparently the temperature actually needs to be much\nlower for atomic hydrogen to survive, such that even among\u21e0 2b i l l i o np h o t o n sp e rb a r y o n\nwe cannot \ufb01nd one photon energetic enough to ionize hydrogen. What we have learned is\nthat the recombination process, or more precisely the relative fraction of hydrogen which\nis ionized, has to depend on the baryon to photon ratio. Let\u2019s work out the mathematics\nbehind this using the equilibrium distribution functions that we have learned about.\nWe will make some simplifying assumptions here. First, we will assume the Universe is a\npure hydrogen plasma so that we don\u2019t need to worry about Helium nuclei. We will learn\nin the next lecture that the universe is actually\u21e0 10% Helium by number or about 25%\nHelium by mass, so this is not going to be a big correction, but it does simplify the math.\nSecond, and more important, we will calculate the fraction of the total hydrogen which is\nionized assuming LTE. This turns out to be a good approximation at early times, but then\nbreaks down as recombination proceeds, because the reactions above fall out of chemical\nequilibrium. We will work out the full non-equilibrium treatment next.\nOur goal is to follow thefree electron fractionor ionized fraction as a function of time\nXe \u2318 ne\nnp + nH\n= ne\nnB\n= np\nnB\n, (16)\nwhere our assumption of a pure hydrogen plasma impliesnB = np + nH and np = ne.\nConsider LTE between the electrons, protons, neutral atoms, and photons. In this case we\ncan write the reactions above as\np + e\u0000 $ H+ \u0000. (17)\nLTE implies that all particles obey the equilibrium distributions we derived previously, and\nthat we also have chemical equilibrium\n\u00b5p + \u00b5e = \u00b5H, (18)\nwhere we have used the fact that photons have zero chemical potential\u00b5\u0000 = 0. Now that\nwe are interested in chemical equilibrium, we need to retain the chemical potential in all the\ndistribution functions.\n4\nFigure 2: Free electron fraction as a function of redshift.

(25)\nFig. 2 shows the the redshift evolution of the free electron fraction as predicted both by the\nSaha equation above, and the more exact full non-equilibrium treatment using the Boltzmann\n(see below). The Saha approximation, which assumes LTE, correctly identi\ufb01es the onset of\nrecombination, but it is clearly insu\u0000cient if the aim is to determine the relic density of elec-\ntrons after freeze-out, since the Saha solution is just based on equilibrium thermodynamics\nand knows nothing about the reaction rate \u0000 relative to the Hubble time.\n1.3 Time of Recombination\nLet us de\ufb01ne the recombination temperatureTrec as the temperature whereXe =0 .1, that\nis when 90% of the electrons have combined with protons to form neutral hydrogen. This\nchoice is obviously somewhat arbitrary, but given that the Saha solution saysXe plummets\nexponentially, it won\u2019t matter much what we choose. Furthermore this is a regime where\nLTE still appears to be a reasonably valid assumption given the curves in Fig. 2. We \ufb01nd\nTrec \u21e1 3600 K' 0.3e V\nkB\n.

(31)\n1.4 Electron Freeze-Out\nIn Fig. 2 we see that a residual ionization fraction of electrons freezes out when the interac-\ntions in eqn. (17) become ine\u0000cient. To follow the free electron fraction after freeze-out, we\nneed to solve the Boltzmann equation, just as we did for the dark matter freeze-out. One\ncan obtain an order of magnitude estimate by applying the criterion\n\u0000(T)= neh\u0000vi\u21e0 H(T), (32)\nwhich you will do in the homework.

This is reasonably close to the true value, but\nslightly overestimated.\nThis residual abundance of electrons is important for two reasons. First, they are required\nto catalyze the formation of molecular hydrogen later on, and molecular hydrogen is crucial\nto cool gas to low enough temperatures so that the \ufb01rst stars can form. Second, as we will\nsee momentarily, the photons stop scattering o\u21b5 of the electrons just afer recombination.\nHowever, because the photon to baryon ratio is so high\u21e0 109,t h e s er a r es c a t t e r i n ge v e n t s\nbetween electrons and photons nevertheless continue to heat the electrons, which transfer this\nheat to the protons via Coulomb interactions. As a result, the temperature of the baryons\nremains coupled to that of the radiation and drops of asT / a\u00001, instead of theT / a\u00002\nthat a frozen out non-relativistic gas would usually follow in the absence of interactions.\nThus the temperature of the baryons follows the temperature of the CMB until much later\ntimes z \u21e0 150 than recombination/decoupling.\n9\n2 Photon Decoupling\nAs stated earlier, photons are most strongly coupled to the primordial plasma through their\nscattering interactions with electrons\ne\u0000 + \u0000 $ e\u0000 + \u0000, (49)\nwhich has an interaction rate given by\n\u0000\u0000 = ne\u0000T c = XenB\u0000T c (50)\nwhere \u0000T =6 .65 \u21e5 10\u000023 cm2 is the Thompson cross-section. Since \u0000\u0000 / ne,t h ei n t e r a c t i o n\nrate decreases as the density of free electrons drops. Photons and electrons decouple roughly\nwhen the interaction rate becomes smaller than the expansion rate,\n\u0000\u0000(Tdec) \u21e0 H(Tdec). (51)\nAgain using eqn.

(52)\nThe redshift of decouplingzdec is de\ufb01ned to be that for which \u0000\u0000/H = 1. Note that in the\nabove equation Xe is a function of redshift, which we have plotted in Fig. 2. One can see\nthat Xe drops abruptly during recombination, the factor of 113 in the equation above is\neasily overcome. For this reason recombination and decoupling happen at roughly the same\ntime.\nThe redshift and time of decoupling are\nzdec \u21e0 1090 (53)\ntdec \u21e0 380, 000 yr (54)\nAfter decoupling the photons stream freely. Observations of the cosmic microwave back-\nground today allow us to probe the conditions at last-scattering.\n10\nPhys 236: Cosmology\nLecture 9: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis\nLet us return toT \u21e0 1M e V o r a b o u t 1 s a f t e r t h e B i g B a n g . P h o t o n s , e l e c t r o n s , p o s i t r o n s ,\nneutrinos and anti-neutrinos are in thermal equilibrium. The neutrinos are about to decou-\nple. Baryons are non-relativistic and therefore much fewer in number than the relativistic\nspecies as expressed by the extremely small baryon to photon ratio\u2318 \u21e0 5 \u21e510\u000010. Neverthe-\nless, we now want to study what happened to these trace amounts of baryonic matter. The\ntotal number of nucleons stays constant due to baryon number conservation. This baryon\nnumber can be in the form of protons and neutrons or heavier nuclei. Weak nuclear reactions\nmay convert neutrons and protons into each other and strong nuclear reactions may build\nnuclei from them. In this lecture, we will learn how the light elements \u2013 hydrogen\u2019s isotope\ndeuterium, helium, and lithium were synthesized in the Big Bang. It turns out that the\nprimordial synthesis of these elements provides one of the earliest and most stringest tests\nof the standard cosmology, and an important test of particle physics. As we will discuss,\nthe present state of agreement between theory and observation indicates that the standard\ncosmology is a valid description of the universe at least back to times as early\u21e0 10\u00002 sec\nafter the Big Bang and temperatures as high as\u21e0 10 MeV.\nIn its full generality, BBN is a very complicated process involving many coupled Boltzmann\nequations to track all the nuclear abundances, informed by collision strengths for all of the\nnuclear reactions. In practice, however, two simpli\ufb01cations will make our life much easier\n1. No elements heaver than helium.\nFor reasons that we will explain, essentially no elements heavier than helium are pro-\nduced at appreciable levels. So the only nuclei that we need to track are hydrogen and\nhelium, and their isotopes: deuterium, tritium, and3He.\n2. Only neutrons and protons above 0.1 MeV.\nAbove T \u21e1 0.1 MeV only free protons and neutrons exist, while other light nuclei\nhaven\u2019t been formed yet. Therefore, we can \ufb01rst solve for the neutron/proton ratio\nand then use this abundance as the initial conditions for the synthesis of deuterium,\nhelium, etc.\nAt some level the zeroth order goal of this lecture is to provide a theoretical explanation for\none number: the ratio of the density of helium to hydrogen\nnHe\nnH\n' 1\n16 or by mass Y = \u21e2(4He)\n\u21e2B\n' 1\n4 (1)\n1 Lightning Introduction to Nuclear Physics\nA single proton is a hydrogen nucleus, referred to as\n1H or simply p;( 2 )\n1\nAp r o t o na n dan e u t r o nm a k eu pd e u t e r i u m :\n2Ho r D. (3)\nOne proton and two neutrons make tritium:\n3Ho r T. (4)\nNuclei with two protons are helium; these can have\none neutron: 3He or two neutrons: 4He. (5)\nThus unique elements have a \ufb01xed number ofZ protons, and isotopes of a given element\nhave di\u21b5ering numbers of neutrons. The total number of nucleons, i.e. neutrons and protons,\nin the nucleus, is known as theatomic numberor mass numberA,w h i c hi sl i s t e da sa\nsuperscript before the name of the element.\nThe total mass of a nucleus withZ protons andA\u0000Z neutrons di\u21b5ers slightly from the mass\nof the individual protons and neutrons alone. This di\u21b5erence is called the binding energy,\nde\ufb01ned as\nBA = Zmpc2 +( A \u0000 Z)mnc2 \u0000 mAc2, (6)\nwhere mp and mn are the mass of the proton and neutron, respectively, andmA is the mass\nof the nucleus. For example, the mass of deuterium is 1875.62 MeV while the sum of the\nneutron and proton masses is 1877.84 MeV, so the binding energy of deuterium is 2.22 MeV.\nAlthough the nucleons have\u21e0 GeV mass energy, nuclear binding energies are typically in\nthe MeV range, which explains why Big Bang nucleosynthesis occurs at temperatures a bit\nless than 1 MeV.\nThe binding energyBA of a nucleus is the energy required to pull it apart into its component\nprotons and neutrons. Equivalently, it is the energy released when a nucleus is fused together\nfrom individual protons and neutrons. I \ufb01nd it helpful to consider the analogy with ionization\nand recombination processes, which are typically more familiar. For example, we just studied\nthe reaction\np+ + e\u0000 $ H+ \u0000 (7)\nwhere \u0000 is a photon, and we know that photon energies in excess of the binding energy\nBH =1 3.6 eV are required to ionize hydrogen.\nThis can be compared to the reaction which synthesizes deuterium\np+ + n $ D+ \u0000, (8)\nwhere in order to break D we require a gamma ray photon \u0000 more energetic than the\nbinding energy of Deuterium BD =2 .22 MeV. The deuteron is in fact not very tightly\nbound compared to other atomic nuclei. Fig. 1 plots the binding energy per necleuonBA/A\nfor atomic nuclei with di\u21b5erent mass numbers. Note that4He has a very highBA/A =7 . 0 7\nor total binding energyBA =2 8.30 MeV making it relatively tightly bound compared to\nother light nuclei withA \uf8ff 10. The most tightly bound nuclei are those of56Fe, 58Fe, and\n2\n61Ni. Thus nuclei less massive than iron or nickel can release energy by fusion \u2013 merging\ninto heavier nuclei. Whereas nuclei more massive than iron or nickel can release energy by\n\ufb01ssion \u2013 splitting into lighter nuclei.\nFinally, we will quantify abundances of the light elements via the mass fraction of a nuclear\nspecies A(Z),\nXA = nAA\nnB\n; nB = nn + np +\nX\nA\nAnA, (9)\nwhere P\nA XA =1a n dnB = \u2318n\u0000 is the total number density of baryons (whether bound or\nfree) and\u2318 is the baryon-to-photon ratio.\nTable 1: Binding Energies of Light Elements\nAZB A gA kBTnuc\n2H2 . 2 2 M e V30 . 0 7 M e V\n3H6 . 9 2 M e V2\n3He 7.72 MeV 2 0.11 MeV\n4He 28.3 MeV 1 0.28 MeV\n12C9 2 . 2 M e V 1 0 . 2 5 M e V\nTable 2: Binding energies BA for light elements.

For electrons, you showed in the homework that this results\nfrom the charge neutrality of the universe and the extremely small baryon to photon ratio.\nFor neutrinos this is an assumption that is very likely to be true1.\nThus we see that forT \u0000 1 MeV, there are as many neutrons as protons. However, for\nT< 1 MeV, the neutron fraction is exponentially suppressed as shown in Fig. 2. Recall\nthat Q =( mn \u0000 mp)c2 \u2318 1.30 MeV, thus protons are the lower energy \u2018bound state\u2019, and\nas the universe cools down it is not energetically favorable to have any neutrons around.\nThis is exactly the same principle behind forming the \ufb01rst atoms during recombination,\ni.e. the bound state H is energetically preferred once you cool down enough. If the weak\ninteractions would operate e\u0000ciently enough to maintain equilibrium inde\ufb01nitely, then the\nneutron abundance would drop to zero. Luckily, in the real world the weak interactions are\nnot so e\u0000cient. To get the \ufb01nal \u201cfreeze-out\u201d abundancenn/np we will need to do a full\nnon-equilibrium Boltzmann calculation, which we will come to momentarily.\n2.2 Deuterium\nNow let\u2019s consider deuterium,2H, an isotope of hydrogen with one proton and one neutron.\nBBN takes place through a series of two-body reactions, building heavier nuclei step by step.\nThe essential \ufb01rst step is the fusion of a proton and neutron to form a deuteron\np+ + n $ D+ \u0000. (15)\nFor the present calculation we will take the input neutron abundance to be a \ufb01xed initial\ncondition, which is a reasonable assumption given that the freeze-out neutron abundance is\nset in place before deuterium synthesis begins (see Fig. 2).\nNote again that the deuterium reaction has exactly the same form as the recombination-\nphotoionization reaction\np+ + e\u0000 $ H+ \u0000. (16)\nIn that context, we derived the Saha equation\nnH\nnpne\n=\n\u2713 2\u21e1~2\nmekBT\n\u25c63/2\nexp\n\u2713 BH\nkBT\n\u25c6\n, (17)\nwhich states that neutral hydrogen is favored in the limitkBT ! 0, whereas ionized hydrogen\nis favored in the limitkBT !1 .\nIn analogy with our procedure for recombination, the assumption of chemical equilibrium\nfor deuterium\n\u00b5p + \u00b5n = \u00b5D, (18)\n1The exact same calculation that you performed in the homework applies to neutrinos, implying\u00b5\u232b/\nkBT \u21e0 (n\u232b \u0000n\u00af\u232b)/n\u0000. However, since the relic neutrino background has not been directly detected we cannot\nuse the charge neutrality argument to estimate the di\u21b5erence in the numbers of particles to anti-particles as\nwe did for the electron. So we are implicitly assuming that similar to the small Baryon numbernB \u0000n \u00afB the\nuniverse also has a small lepton number and thus (n\u232b \u0000 n\u00af\u232b)/n\u0000 \u2327 1.\n6\nimplies the relative numbers of free protons, free neutrons, and deuterons are given by a\ncompletely analogous equation\nnD\nnpnn\n= gD\ngngp\n\u2713 mD\nmpmn\n\u25c63/2 \u27132\u21e1~2\nkBT\n\u25c63/2\nexp\n\uf8ff(mp + mn \u0000 mD)c2\nkBT\n\u0000\n=6\n\u2713 \u21e1~2\nmnkBT\n\u25c63/2\nexp\n\u2713 BD\nkBT\n\u25c6\n,\n(19)\nwhere in the last equality we used the de\ufb01nition of the binding energy of deuterium\nBD \u2318 (mp + mn \u0000 mD)c2 =2 .22 MeV, (20)\nplugged in the degeneracy factor for the deuteron (spin= 1,gD =3 ) ,t h ep r o t o na n dn e u t r o n\n(gp = gn =2 ) ,a n da g a i nu s e dt h ea p p r o x i m a t i o nmp \u21e1 mn \u21e1 mD/2i nt h em a s sr a t i oi n\nthe pre-factor. Thus we end up with an equation equivalent to the Saha equation which\ndescribes nuclear statistical equilibrium(NSE). Similar to electron/protons vs. atoms,\nwe see that there should be no deuterium (bound state) in the limit ofkBT !1 ,b u t\ndeuterium is favored in the limitkBT ! 0.\nSimilar to our approach for recombination, let\u2019s obtain an estimate for the temperature\nTnuc at which deuterium becomes favored. To do this we will de\ufb01ne the time of \u201cdeuterium\nsynthesis\u201d to be atnD/nB \u21e0 1, when the deuterium abundance is a number of order unity. In\nthe next section we will learn that the freeze-out neutron abundance when neutrons decouple\n(before deuterium synthesis) is\nnn/nB = 1\n6 or np =0 .83nB (21)\nand even today' 75% of all baryons in the universe are in the form of unbound protons.\nSo we can approximiately takenn ' nB/6a n dnp ' nB which gives\nnD\nnB\n\u21e1 nB\n\u2713 \u21e1~2\nmpkBT\n\u25c63/2\nexp\n\u2713 BD\nkBT\n\u25c6\n, (22)\nwhere we substitutedmnc2 \u21e1 mpc2 =9 3 8.3 MeV. Similar to our approach for recombination\nwe can express the baryon density in terms of the baryon to photon ratio\nnB = \u2318n\u0000 = \u2318 \u21e5 2(kBT)3\u21e3(3)\n\u21e12~3c3 , (23)\nand we \ufb01nally obtain\nXD \u2318 nD\nnB\n\u21e1 \u2318\n\u2713 kBT\nmpc2\n\u25c63/2\nexp\n\u2713 BD\nkBT\n\u25c6\n, (24)\nNot surprisingly, this equation has the exact same form as our equation for the ionized\nfraction Xe during recombination.\nAs long asBD/kBT is not too large, the pre-factor\u2318 dominates this expression. Recall that\nthis pre-factor is extremely small becuase of the small\u2318 ' 5.5 \u21e5 10\u000010 baryon to photon\nratio.

(26)\nThe reason whykBTnuc is a factor of\u21e0 30 lower than the binding energy is again because of\nthe extremely large number of photons to baryons, which can be seen in the equation above.\nIndeed, the temperature is only logarithimically sensitive to\u2318,b u tb e c a u s e\u2318 is so small this\nnevertheless has a signi\ufb01cant e\u21b5ect on the temperature at which we can form deuterium.\nJust like in the case of recombination, the interpretation is that because photons outnumber\nbaryons by such a gigantic factor, there are many high energy photons than can immediately\ndestroy nuclei that are formed when the temperature is around the binding energy. In order\nfor it to be energetically favorable to form bound states like deuterium, we need to lower the\ntemperature enough such that even the photons in the high-energy tail of the distribution\nare not abundant enough to inhibit deuterium production.\nThis is what is known as thedeuterium bottleneck.A t o m i c n u c l e i a r e b u i l t u p s e q u e n t i a l l y\nfrom lighter elements via two-body reactions. This implies that helium nuclei cannot be\nformed directly from neutrons and protons, because the densities are too low and the time\navailable is too short for reactions involving three or more incoming nuclei to occur at an\nappreciable rate. The small baryon to photon ratio inhibits the production of deuterium\nuntil the temperature drops well beneath its nuclear binding energy. At temperatures above\n0.1 MeV, then, virtually all baryons are in the form of neutrons and protons. Around this\ntime, deuterium (and then immediately helium) are produced, but the reaction rates are by\nthis time too low to produce any heavier elements. We will come back to this point when\nwe discuss full non-equilibrium solutions.\n2.3 General Treatment\nGiven a nuclear species with mass numberA = n + p and chargeZ = p,w h e r en =n u m b e r\nof neutrons andp= number of protons in the nucleus, its equilibrium number density is given\nby:\nnA = gA\n\u2713mAkBT\n2\u21e1~2\n\u25c63/2\nexp\n\u2713\u00b5A \u0000 mAc2\nkBT\n\u25c6\n.

Although the weak force can convert protons into neutrons and vice versa,\nthe total number of baryons is conserved in all of the interactions we will be concerned with\nhere. This allows us to relate the chemical potential for the nucleus to that of protons and\nneutrons through:\n\u00b5A = Z\u00b5p +( A \u0000 Z)\u00b5n . (28)\n8\nl\nWe can divide eqn.

Note that the equi-\nlibrium abundances of all bound nuclei are negligible as long as free neutrons and protons\nare in equilibrium due to the small\u2318 factor.\nFigure 3: The NSE mass fractions of all nuclear species withZ \uf8ff 6, for a neutron-to-proton\nratio of 0.14. If the universe had expanded arbitrarily slowly, allowing all nuclear processes to\nreach equilibrium, then the vast majority of the protons and neutrons would become bound\ninto helium-4 nuclei, and later into carbon-12. Figure from Hooper.\n10\n\nBy taking the natural log of the general expression forXA in eqn. (32), we \ufb01nd that theXA\nwill be of order unity at temperatures satisfying\nTnuc ' BA/(A \u0000 1)\nln (\u2318\u00001)+1 .5l n(mpc2/kBT), (35)\nwhich is the generalization of eqn. (35) for deuterium. We see that NSE predicts that\nTnuc =0 .07 MeV for deuterium,Tnuc =0 .11 MeV for3He, Tnuc =0 .28 MeV for4He, and\nTnuc =0 .25 MeV for12C. These values are listed in Table 2.\nFor the sake of illustration, consider the following system of light elements withZ \uf8ff 6:\nneutrons, protons, deuterons, tritium, 3He nuclei, 4He nuclei, and the istopes of C,12C,\n13C, and 14C nuclei. A solution to the NSE system of equations in eqn. (34) is shown in\nFig. 3. We can clearly see that although the binding energies per nucleon are of the order\nof 1 to 8 MeV (see Table 2), the equilibrium abundance of nuclear species does not become\nof order unity until a temperature of order 0.3 MeV. This is due to the high entropy of the\nUniverse, that is, the very small value of\u2318. Although for temperatures less than a few MeV\nnuclei are favored on energetic grounds, entropy considerations (i.e. the extremely small\nbaryon-to-photon ratio\u2318) favor free nucleons, and the entropy of the Universe is very high.\nAnother important thing to note from this simple example and eqn. (32) is that in NSE the\nmost bound heavy elements are favored as the temperature is decreased (which would be\nlate times). This simple illustrative calculation was cuto\u21b5 at CarbonZ =6 ,a n dw es e et h a t\nif the universe had expanded arbitrarily slowly, allowing all nuclear processes adequate time\nto reach equilibrium, then the vast majority of the protons and neutrons would \ufb01rst become\nbound into helium-4 nuclei, and later into carbon-12. These two isotopes each stand out in\npart because of their high binding energies per nucleon (see Table 2 and Fig. 1).\nHad we extended this calculation to heavier elements we would \ufb01nd that they dominate\nat progressively later times. Indeed, NSE predicts that the end state of the nulceosynthesis\nshould be that all the material in the Universe should be in some iron nickel alloy, since these\nare the most bound heavy elements from Fig. 1. The reason why (fortunately!), this did not\noccur in reality is that the Universe departs from NSE. The important thing to note is that\nNSE knows nothing about reaction rates or our criteria \u0000\u0000 H. When we assume NSE, we\nassume that the Universe has enough time to arrive at thermal and chemical equilbrium, and\nthe relative abundances of states simply depend on their relative energies and the relative\nnumbers of particles (e.g. photons to baryons). In the next section, we consider the non-\nequilibrium calculation that is required to determine the freeze-out abundance of neutrons.\n3 Neutron Freeze Out\nIn this section we want to solve for the non-equilibrium neutron-proton ratio that constitutes\nthe initial conditions for BBN. As we see in eqns. (10) weak interactions convert protons\ninto neutrons, and these reactions stay in equilibrium atT & 3M e V . A t l a t e r t i m e s ( l o w e r\ntemperatures) one must use the Boltzmann equation to track the neutron abundance.

The \ufb01rst\nnucleus to form is therefore deuterium\nn + p $ D+ \u0000. (56)\nOnly when there is enough deuterium can the production of helium in signi\ufb01cant numbers\ncommence via reactions like\nD+ p $ 3He +\u0000\nD+ 3He $ 4He +p (57)\nBecause of thedeuterium bottleneck,w h i c hi st os a yt h a td e u t e r i u mp r o d u c t i o ni sd e l a y e d\nuntil Tnuc ' 0.07 MeV (t =2 6 9 s ) ,h e l i u mp r o d u c t i o nt h u sh a st ow a i tf o rd e u t e r i u m . S i n c e\nthe binding energy of helium is larger than that of deuterium (see Table 2), the Boltzmann\nfactor eB/kBT (see eqn. 32) favors helium over deuterium. Indeed, in Fig. 2 we see that helium\nis produced almost immediately after deuterium begins to form. Thus virtually all of the\nremaining neutrons atT = Tnuc (t = tnuc)a r ep r o c e s s e di n t o4He.

Why wasn\u2019t12C or other heavy elements synthesized in the Big Bang like a naive NSE\ncalculation (see Fig. 3) might suggest? The answer is threefold:\nDeuterium bottleneck The extremely small baryon to photon ratio implies that\nwaiting for deuterium production delays the formation of the \ufb01rst nuclei toTnuc =\n0.07 MeV. By this time the two body reaction rates are too low to produce any heavier\nelements in signi\ufb01cant numbers.\nHelium is exceptionally tightly boundInspection of Fig. 1 illustrates that4He\n16\n0\nconstitutes a local maximum in the binding energy per nucleon. Recall that the Boltz-\nmann factor eB/kBT determines which bound states are preferred. The large binding\nenergy of Helium means it can stick around as the preferred bound state for a long\ntime e\u21b5ectively terminiating BBN, because by the time the universe would be cool\nenough to prefer more tightly bound states the reaction rates are already too low and\neverything is frozen out.\nLack of a stable istopesGlancing at Fig. 1 we see that there are no stable isotopes\nwith atomic numberA =5o r A =8 . E x o t i ci s o t o p e sl i k e5He, 5Li, or 8Be are wildly\nunstable with extremely short half-lives. This means once 4He is created, heavier\nelements cannot be produced via a reaction like\n4He +p ! 5X. (59)\nWhat about the fusion of two or more4He nuclei? In massive stars, with core tem-\nperatures above 0.01 MeV, helium can fuse into carbon via the so-called triple alpha\nprocess 4He +4He ! 8Be (60)\nfollowed by 8Be +4He ! 12C+2 \u0000. (61)\nThe fact that8Be is unstable with a very short lifetime, however, makes this process\nvery slow. It is e\u21b5ective over the lifetime of a star, but not within the few minutes\navailable for BBN. More generally, the lack of any stable nuclei withA =5o r A =8\nand the fact that densities are too low and time available too short (set by the Hubble\nexpansion) to allow three nuclei to \ufb01nd one another implies heavier elements are not\ncreated in signi\ufb01cant numbers.\n5 Observations and Constraints on the Standard Model\n5.1 Observations of Primordial Abundances\nThe challenge of using observations to compare with BBN is that the early universe is not the\nonly place where the number of elements are changed: nucleosynthesis in stars forms heavy\nelements and can burn up primordial light elements. Nonetheless we can often tell when\nthis is a problem, because heavy elements are only produced in signi\ufb01cant numbers in stars,\nso places where we see many heavy elements are clearly contaminated. Instead constraints\ncan be placed by looking for low metallicity systems \u2013 those with few heavy elements so\nthat the observed abundances may better re\ufb02ect the primordial abundances (\u201cmetals\u201d in\nastrophysics are all the elements except hydrogen and helium). If the metallicity dependence\nof the abundance of interest can be judged, it may also be possible to extrapolate from\nobservations to zero metallicity, even though we see no entirely uncontaminated systems.\nDeuterium:M e a s u r e m e n t s o f t h e p r i m o r d i a l d e u t e r i u m a b u n d a n c e a r e p e r h a p s o u r\nsingle most powerful probe of the universe during its \ufb01rst few minutes. A major chal-\nlenge in these determinations is the small binding energy of deuterium, which makes\n17\nit easily destroyed in stars.

T h i sc a nb er e m e d i e d\nby measuring the deuterium abundance in regions devoid of metals and hence with\nlittle evidence of destruction by stellar nucleosynthesis. For this we rely on observa-\ntions of high-redshift (i.e. very early) environments. In this regard, strong absorption\nline systems such as damped Lyman-\u21b5 systems and Lyman limit systems (LLSs) are\nparticularly useful. The strong Lyman-\u21b5 absorption systems are dense regions in high-\nredshift galaxies, for which it is possible to use precision spectroscopy to measure the\nhydrogen and deuterium column densities, as illustrated in Fig. 6. At present, only\nhandfuls of such measurements have been made, but these have been used to pre-\ncisely determine (e.g. arXiv:1710.11129) (D/H)p =2 .527 \u00b1 0.030 \u21e5 10\u00005; where the\np subscript indicates we are referring to the primordial value of this ratio. The mea-\nsured value of this quantity doesn\u2019t show any correlation with redshift or metallicity (a\nmeasure of past star formation), supporting the conclusion that these measurements\nre\ufb02ect the true primordial value. In contrast, measurements of the relative deuterium\nabundance in the Solar System and in the Milky Way show considerable variation,\nwhich is anti-correlated with the presence of metals, indicative of the impact of stellar\nprocessing.\nHelium-4: This is a very strongly bound nucleus, so it is not destroyed by stellar\nprocesses, but is produced in stars together with other elements: the observed abun-\ndance should be larger than the primordial one.

These mea-\nsurements reveal a correlation between the4He abundance and the presence of metals\nin the system, indicating contamination of helium produced through fusion in stars.\nExtrapolating this relationship to zero metallicity results in a determination (from\narXiv:1112.3713) YP =0 .253 \u00b1 0.01 which compares well with the BBN prediction of\naround 0.248 for Planck baryon density parameters.\nHelium-3: Determinations of the primordial abundance of helium-3 have proven dif-\n\ufb01cult. Measurements of3He have been made in the Solar System and the interstellar\nstellar medium, each indicating3H/H ' 1.1 \u00b10.2 \u21e510\u00005.T h a t b e i n g s a i d ,3He is both\ndestroyed and created in stars at relevant rates, making it unclear whether these mea-\nsurements are truly indicative of the primordial value. For this reason, most modern\nBBN analyses do not make use of any measurements of3He.\nLithium:L i t h i u m a b u n d a n c e s a r e m o s t r e a d i l y d e t e r m i n e d b y s p e c t r o s c o p i c m e a s u r e -\nments of low-metallicity dwarf stars.

The other measurements\nthen provide a highly non-trivial consistency check on BBN predictions. They also constrain\nthe number of additional light neutrinos or any other contribution to the energy densities at\nvery high redshifts that would have changed the expansion rate during BBN.\nThe value of\u2318 that is observed, giving \u2326b ' 0.05, is broadly consistent with independent\nmeasurements at a redshift ofz \u21e0 1100 from the anisotropies in the CMB. Once \u2326b or \u2318\nis \ufb01xed, we can then test observations of other abundances against the BBN predictions.\nThese are broadly consistent for deuterium and helium-4. For lithium, observations suggest\nlithium is present at the order of magnitude predicted by BBN, but in detail signi\ufb01cantly\nless is observed than we\u2019d expect; this is sometimes called the \u2018lithium problem\u2019 (see e.g.\narXiv:1203.3551).

The fact that we \ufb01nd reasonably good quantitative agreement with observations\nis one of the great triumphs of the Big Bang model.\n5.2 BBN Predctions and Testing the Standard Model\nThe primordial abundances of light elements depends on the following parameters:\nNeutron lifetime: which is used to express the rate of the weak interactions. Nowa-\ndays, this is pretty well-known. If\u2327n were larger, for example, then we would have a\nsmaller interaction rate, which would imply a larger neutron freeze-out temperature\nand larger neutron-to-proton ratio, and therefore a larger4He abundance.\nBaryon-to-photon ratio\u2318:T h e m a s s f r a c t i o n f o r t h e n u c l e a r s p e c i e s i s p r o p o r t i o n a l\nto this parameter, so the smaller\u2318 is, the smallerXA (photon-destruction of formed\nnuclei remains e\u21b5ective until lower temperatures when there are more photons per\nbaryon). A higher\u2318 means that the mass fractions for the deuterium, tritium and3He\nbuild up earlier, so that the synthesis of4He is more e\u0000cient, we get more helium and\nless is left of the lighter nuclei. This number can be constrained both from comparison\nof BBN predictions with data, and also independently through the detailed shape of\nthe spectrum of anisotropies in the CMB.\nE\u21b5ective number of relativistic degrees of freedom:o r e q u i v a l e n t l y , t h e t o t a l\nenergy density at the time of BBN.

(62)\n19\nAn extra relativistic degree of freedom means more energy density in radiation, and a\nlarger expansion rate. Therefore, the Universe will be younger at a given temperature,\ni.e. the pre-factor in eqn. 53 would be smaller. This means that the time between\nthe temperature when neutrinos freeze-out and the temperatureTnuc when deuterium\nstarts forming would be shorter, and there would thus be less time for neutrons to\ndecay (see e.g. eqn. 54). The neutron-to-proton ratio is therefore larger at the on-\nset of nucleosynthesis and so is the \ufb01nal primordial helium abundance. Observations\nconstrain the extra number of neutrino families to be less than one.\n20\nFigure 6: Lyman series transitions for a \u201cLyman Limit System\u201d atzabs =2 .504 towards the\nquasar Q1000+2956.

The structures observed today, such as galaxies\nand groups and clusters of galaxies are assumed to have grown from small initial density\nperturbations due to gravitational instability. In this scenario, structure formation in the\nUniverse involves the following two aspects: (i) the properties and origin of the initial density\nperturbations, and (ii) the time evolution of the cosmological perturbations in an expanding\nUniverse.\nOne of the great successes of the \u21e4 cold dark matter (\u21e4CDM) cosmological model is that the\nsame theory which perfectly describes the temperature anisotropies in the CMB in the re-\ncombination era just' 400, 000 years after the Big Bang (z \u21e0 1100), also precisely describes\nthe clustering pattern of galaxies observed in the local universe (z \u21e0 0), some' 14 Gyr later.\nAc o m p a r i s o no fo b s e r v e da n dp r e d i c t e dg a l a x yc l u s t e r i n gp a t t e r n sa r es h o w nq u a l i t a t i v e l y\nin the left panel of Fig. 1.

In a nutshell, our goal for the next few lectures is to develop the\nmathematical formalism used to quantify these density \ufb02uctuations, learn how density \ufb02uc-\ntuations evolve when the perturbations are small, and ultimately understand why the power\nspectrum of density \ufb02uctuations,P(k), shown in the right panel of Fig. 1 has the shape that\nit does.\nFigure 1: Left: Distribution of dark matter density from a numerical simulation of galaxy\nclustering.

In this section we describe the basic statistical properties imposed upon such \ufb01elds\nunder the assumption that the physics which generated the initial \ufb02uctuations, and subse-\nquently processes them, respects the symmetries of the background cosmology, which is to\nsay homogeneity and isotropy.\nIn what follow we will denote expectation values with angle brackets, e.g.h\u0000\u21e2i.Y o u c a n\nthink of this as either a quantum mechanical expectation value or an average over some\nstatistical ensemble of universes. While formally this ensemble of universes only exists in\nour minds, more practially we can imagine that these averages over the statistical ensemble\nare equivalent to averaging over representative volumes of the real universe.\n1.1 Random Fields\nConsider a random \ufb01eld\u0000(x)\u2013i . e .a te a c hp o i n tx in space\u0000(x)i ss o m es t o c h a s t i cv a r i a b l e\nwith zero meanh\u0000(x)i =0 . O f t e nw ew i l lf o c u so nt h eo v e r d e n s i t y\ufb01 e l d\u0000(x)=( \u21e2\u0000\u00af\u21e2)/\u00af\u21e2,b u t\nthe formalism we are developing applies to any cosmological random \ufb01eld. The probability\nof realizing some \ufb01eld con\ufb01guration is afunctional P[\u0000(x)], which is to say a function of\naf u n c t i o n\u0000(x). We can make the mathematics less abstract if we imagine dividing the\nUniverse into n in\ufb01nitesimal cells which are centered atx1, x2,. . . xn where they have\nvalues \u0000(x1), \u0000(x2), ... \u0000(xn). The random perturbation \ufb01eld\u0000(x)i st h e nc h a r a c t e r i z e db y\nthe probability distribution function\nP(\u00001,\u0000 2,. . . ,\u0000n)d\u00001d\u00002...d\u0000n, (1)\nwhere now P is the function which gives the probability that the \ufb01eld\u0000 has values in the\nrange \u0000i to \u0000i + d\u0000i at positions xi.\nCorrelators of \ufb01elds are expectation values of products of \ufb01elds at di\u21b5erent spatial locations\n(and, generally, times), which we denote with angle brackets. The distributon functionP is\ncompletely determined if we know all of its moments\nh\u0000`1\n1 \u0000`2\n2 ...\u0000`n\nn i\u2318\nZ\n\u0000`1\n1 \u0000`2\n2 ...\u0000`n\nn P(\u00001,\u0000 2,. . . ,\u0000n)d\u00001d\u00002...d\u0000n, (2)\nwhere the`i are non-negative integers.\nSince the cosmological principle requires all positions and directions in the Universe to\n2\nbe equivalent, the cosmological density \ufb01eld must bestatistically homogeneous and\nisotropic. This implies that all moments are invariant under spatial translation and rota-\ntion. For example, the \ufb01rst moment\nh\u0000(x)i =0 , (3)\nwhich follows directly from the de\ufb01nition of the density perturbation \ufb01eld. The second\nmoment\n\u00002 = h\u00002(x)i, (4)\nmust also be independent of x. Another imortant moment is the two-point correlation\nfunction\n\u21e0(x)= h\u0000(x1)\u0000(x2)i, with x \u2318| x1 \u0000 x2|, (5)\nwhere by statistical homogeneity and isotropy,\u21e0(x)m u s td e p e n do n l yo nt h ea m p l i t u d eo f\nthe di\u21b5erence|x1 \u0000 x2|.\nWe will often \ufb01nd it useful to decompose the density peturbation into its constituent Fourier\nmodes1:\n\u0000(x)=\nZ d3k\n(2\u21e1)3 \u0000(k)eik\u00b7 x and \u0000(k)=\nZ\nd3x\u0000(x)e\u0000ik\u00b7 x. (6)\nNote that\u0000(k)i sac o m p l e xq u a n t i t ys ow ec a nw r i t e\n\u0000(k)= A(k)+ iB(k)= |\u0000(k)|ei\u0000(k). (7)\nBut since\u0000(x)i sar e a l\ufb01 e l d ,t h e n\u0000\u21e4(k)= \u0000(\u0000k)w h i c hi m p l i e sA(k)= A(\u0000k)a n dB(k)=\n\u0000B(\u0000k). The statistical properties of\u0000(k)w o u l dt h u sa l s of u l l yd e s c r i b et h ep r o p e r t i e so f\n\u0000(x). Speci\ufb01cally, we also have the distribution function\nP(\u0000k1 ,\u0000 k2 ,. . . ,\u0000kn )d|\u0000k1 |d|\u0000k2 |...d|\u0000kn |d\u0000k1 d\u0000k2 ...d\u0000kn , (8)\nwhich gives the probability that the modes\u0000ki have amplitudes in the range|\u0000ki | to |\u0000ki | +\nd|\u0000ki | and phases in the range\u0000ki to d\u0000ki .\nWe can similarly compute correlators ink-space. For example, consider the two-point cor-\nrelation of the Fourier transform of\u0000(x) between wavenumbersk and k0\nh\u0000(k)\u0000\u21e4(k0)i =\nZ\nd3x\nZ\nd3x0h\u0000(x)\u0000(x0)ie\u0000ik\u00b7 xeik0\u00b7 x0\n. (9)\nBut given statistical homogeneity and isotropy (see eqn. 5) we can write\nh\u0000(x)\u0000(x0)i = \u21e0(|x \u0000 x0|). (10)\n1Note that there is no consensus on where to put the factors of (2\u21e1)3 in these Fourier transforms. Some\nauthors put the (2\u21e1)3 in spatial integral, others adopt a symmetric convention with a factor of (2\u21e1)3/2 in\nboth integrals. This can be a signi\ufb01cant source of confusion.\n3\nThus\nh\u0000(k)\u0000\u21e4(k0)i =\nZ\nd3x\nZ\nd3x0\u21e0(|x \u0000 x0|)e\u0000ik\u00b7 xeik0\u00b7 x0\n, (11)\nand changing variables from fromx0 to z = x0 \u0000 x we get\nh\u0000(k)\u0000\u21e4(k0)i =\nZ\nd3xe\u0000i(k\u0000k0)\u00b7 x\nZ\nd3z\u21e0(z)eik0\u00b7 z. (12)\nNow using the de\ufb01ntion of the Dirac delta function\n\u0000D(q)= 1\n(2\u21e1)3\nZ\nd3xe\u0000iq\u00b7 x, (13)\nwe get\nh\u0000(k)\u0000\u21e4(k0)i =( 2\u21e1)3\u0000D(k \u0000 k0)P(k), (14)\nwhere thepower spectrumis de\ufb01ned as\nP(k) \u2318\nZ\nd3x\u21e0(x)e\u0000ik\u00b7 x. (15)\nThe power spectrum is thus the Fourier transform of the 2-point correlation function, and\nvice versa. Because of statistical homogeneity and isotropy,\u21e0(x) only depends on the norm\nof x,a n dt h er e l a t i o n s h i pb e t w e e nP(k)a n d\u21e0(x)c a nb ef u r t h e rs i m p l i \ufb01 e dt o\nP(k)=\nZ 1\n0\n\u21e0(x)sin(kx)\nkx 4\u21e1x2dx, (16)\nso statistical homogeneity and isotropy also impliesP(k)o n l yd e p e n d so nt h en o r mo fk.\nWe also have the inverse relation\n\u21e0(x)= 1\n(2\u21e1)3\nZ\nd3kP(k)eik\u00b7 x = 1\n(2\u21e1)3\nZ 1\n0\nP(k)sin(kx)\nkx 4\u21e1k2dk = 1\n2\u21e12\nZ 1\n0\nP(k)sin(kx)\nkx k2dk.\n(17)\nWe can evaluate the expression above at \u2018zero lag\u2019 to gain some intuition about the power\nspectrum. At zero lag\u21e0(0) is\n\u21e0(0) =h\u00002(x)i = \u00002, (18)\njust the variance of the \ufb01eld. Thus the equation above implies\n\u00002 = 1\n2\u21e12\nZ 1\n0\nP(k)k2dk = 1\n2\u21e12\nZ 1\n0\nP(k)k3d ln k =\nZ 1\n0\n\u00002(k)d ln k, (19)\nwhere in the last line we de\ufb01ned thedimensionless power spectrum\n\u00002(k)= k3\n2\u21e12 P(k)= d\u00002\nd ln k. (20)\nIt is clear from eqn. (19) that the dimensionless power spectrum quanti\ufb01es the contribution\n4\nto the total variance of\u0000 from each logarithmic wavenumber interval. It is thus a measure\nof the amount of density \ufb02uctuations coming from each spatial scale.\n1.2 Gaussian Random Fields\nAr a n d o m\ufb01 e l d\u0000(x) is said to be Gaussian if the distribution of the \ufb01eld values at an\narbitrary set ofn points (\u00001,\u0000 2,. . . ,\u0000n), which we describe with ann-dimensional row vector,\n\u0000 =( \u00001,\u0000 2,. . . ,\u0000n), is ann-dimensional multivariate Gaussian:\nP(\u00001,\u0000 2,. . . ,\u0000n)= P(\u0000)= 1\n[(2\u21e1)n det(\u21e0)]1/2 exp\n\uf8ff\n\u0000\u0000T \u21e0\u00001\u0000\n2\n\u0000\n, (21)\nwhere the matrix\u21e0 has elements\n\u21e0ij = \u21e0(|xi \u0000 xj|) \u2318h \u0000i\u0000ji. (22)\nIn particular, the one-point distribution of the \ufb01eld itself is also Gaussian\nP(\u0000)= 1\n(2\u21e1\u00002)1/2 exp\n\u2713\n\u0000 \u00002\n2\u00002\n\u25c6\n, (23)\nwhere \u00002 = \u21e0(0) \u2318h \u00002(x)i.\nAny linear combination of Gaussian deviates will also have a Gaussian distribution. This\nallows us to obtain the distribution of\u0000(k)= A(k)+iB(k), since from the Fourier transform,\nthey are a linear combination of\u0000(x), which is Gaussian distributed. As noted before, since\n\u0000(x)i sr e a l ,a n d\u0000\u21e4(k)= \u0000(\u0000k), orA(k)= A(\u0000k)a n dB(k)= \u0000B(\u0000k). This implies that\nwe need only consider Fourier modes withk in the upper half-space to fully specify\u0000(x).\nFurthermore, because of statistical homogeneity and isotropy, the result is even simpler in\nk-space, since the two point function\nh\u0000(k)\u0000\u21e4(k0)i =( 2\u21e1)3\u0000D(k \u0000 k0)P(k), (24)\n(or the covariance) is diagonal. As a result the distribution functions ofA(k)a n dB(k)h a v e\nthe simple form\nP[\u21b5(k)] = 1\n[\u21e1V P(k)]1/2 exp\n\uf8ff\n\u0000 \u21b52(k)\nP(k)V\n\u0000\n, (25)\nwhere \u21b5(k)s t a n d sf o re i t h e rA(k)o rB(k)a n dV is the volume of the domain in question.\nWe thus see that for a Gaussian random \ufb01eld, di\u21b5erent Fourier modes are mutually inde-\npendent, and so are the real and imaginary parts of individual modes. This in turn implies\nthat the phases\u0000(k)o fd i \u21b5 e r e n tm o d e sa r em u t u a l l yi n d e p e n d e n t ,a n dh a v ear a n d o md i s -\ntribution over the interal 0\u0000 2\u21e1.I no t h e rw o r d s ,t h ef o r mo ft h ed i s t r i b u t i o na b o v ei m p l i e s\nthat in terms of|\u0000(k)| and \u0000(k) we have\nPk[|\u0000(k)|,\u0000 (k)]d|\u0000(k)|d\u0000(k)=e x p\n\uf8ff\n\u0000 |\u0000(k)|2\n2VP (k)\n\u0000 |\u0000(k)|d|\u0000(k)|\nVP (k)\nd\u0000(k)\n2\u21e1 . (26)\n5\nThus the Fourier amplitudes|\u0000(k)| follow the Rayleigh distribution, with uncorrelated ran-\ndom phases. It follows that if we want to know the joint distribution of a set of Fourier\nmodes \u0000ki ,i ti sj u s t\nP(\u0000k1 ,\u0000 k2 ,. . . ,\u0000kn )=\nnY\ni\nPk[|\u0000(ki)|,\u0000 (ki)], (27)\nwhere Pk[|\u0000(k)|,\u0000 (k)] is given by eqn. (26). Because the two-point function (covariance)\nis diagonal the probability distribution factorizes into a product of individual probability\ndistributions, which is to say that we can treat\u0000(k)f o re a c hk mode as uncorrelated draws\nfrom independent random processes.\nFigure 2: Left: Distribution of dark matter density from a numerical simulation of galaxy\nclustering.

Whereas one generally needs all moments to fully\nspecify a generic distribution (see eqn. 2) it is intuitive that Gaussianity only requires the\nsecond moments, since by construction our \ufb01elds have zero meanh\u0000(x)i = h\u0000(k)i =0 . M o r e\ngenerally, all correlators of odd numbers of points vanish\nh\u0000(k)i = h\u0000(k1)\u0000(k2)\u0000(k3)i = ... =0 , (28)\nand all correlators of even numbers of points can be expressed in terms of the 2-point function.\n6\no\nFor example, the 4-point function\nh\u0000(k1)\u0000(k2)\u0000(k3)\u0000(k4)i = h\u0000(k1)\u0000(k2)ih\u0000(k3)\u0000(k4)i + h\u0000(k1)\u0000(k3)ih\u0000(k2)\u0000(k4)i\n+ h\u0000(k1)\u0000(k4)ih\u0000(k2)\u0000(k3)i (29)\nIt is much easier to work ink-space. When we solve the equations that govern how\ndensity perturbations \u0000(x)e v o l v e ,w ew i l l\ufb01 n dt h a ti nt h el i n e a rr e g i m e\u0000(x) \u2327 1, the\nprinciple of superposition implies that the Fourier modes\u0000(k) evolve independently implying\nthat\n\u0000(k,t )= D(t)\u0000(k,t i)( 3 0 )\nwhere ti is some early initial time at which we know the \ufb02uctuation spectrum. Thus the\nprobability distribution of the Fourier modes will always be separable as in eqn. (27) and\ndescribed by a power spectrum\nP(k,t )= D2(t)P(k), (31)\nwhere P(k)i st h ep o w e rs p e c t r u ma tt h ei n i t i a lt i m eti.T h i s r e m a r k a b l e s i m p l i \ufb01 c a t i o n i s\nthe result of two factors: 1) statistical homogeneity and isotropy and Gaussianity guarantee\nseparability in the initial conditions, and 2) linearity of the di\u21b5erential equations guaranteeing\nthat k-modes continue to evolve independently (i.e. the principal of superposition).\nNote that the situation is much more complicated in con\ufb01guration space, since eqn. (22)\nindicates that the covariance matrix, which is the two-point correlation function, is not\ndiagonal. Physically what this means is that the density contrast described by a Gaussian\nstatistically isotropic and homogenous \ufb01eld is correlated across positions. Furthermore, linear\nstructure formation via gravitational instability will further correlate the positions. Imagine\nif we setup our initial conditions such that the probability distribution in con\ufb01guration space\nin eqn. (21) could be factorized into a product ofn individual distributions, as is the case\nin k-space (see eqn. 27), which would imply that the overdensity at every position in space\nx is independent of all the other locations. After a short amount of time, the gravitational\nin\ufb02uence of the particles on one another will destroy this mutual independence very quickly,\nresulting in correlated positions.\nGaussianity is intimately related to linear evolution and random phases. Non-\nlinear evolution causes the Gaussian description to break down because themode-mode\ncoupling of distinct Fourier modes implies that eqns. (26) and (27) become invalid. This\nis intimately related to the generation of correlated phases. As we see from the distribution\nfunction in eqn. (26), the phases of the Fourier modes\u0000(k)a r ed i s t r i b u t e du n i f o r m l yo nt h e\ninterval 0 to 2\u21e1. Imagine that we initially have a spectrum of Gaussian primordial density\n\ufb02uctuations such that the initial phase distribution is uniform. When perturbations remain\nsmall evolution proceeds linearly, individual modes grow independently as described above,\nand the original random phase distribution is preserved. However, as perturbations grow\nlarge their evolution becomes non-linear and Fourier modes of di\u21b5erent wavenumber begin\nto couple together. This gives rise to phase association and consequently to non-Gaussianity.\nThe left panel of Fig. 2 shows a cosmological N-body simulation of dark matter clustering\n7\nwhich has evolved to be signi\ufb01cantly non-linear such that it exhibits the familiar \u2018cosmic-\nweb\u2019 structure. Whereas in the right panel, all of the phases of the Fourier modes have been\nrandomly reshu\u270fed. Thus these two pictures have exactly the same power-spectraP(k),\nindeed they even have exactly the same realization of Fourier amplitudes\u0000(k)f o ra l lk.B u t\nthe correlated phases at left, compared to the randomness of phases at right, give rise to a\ntotally di\u21b5erent clustering morphology.\nIn\ufb02ation predicts Gaussian initial \ufb02uctuations.Since a Gaussian \ufb01eld remains Gaus-\nsian during linear evolution, the generic prediction of in\ufb02ationary models is thus that\u0000(x)\nin the linear regime follows Gaussian statistics. To date, all observational tests of this hy-\npothesis have not yet revelaed any evidence for deviations from Gaussianity in the initial\nconditions, which explains why Gaussian random \ufb01elds are so important in cosmology.\n1.3 The Correlation Function\nConsider the two-point correlation function\n\u21e0(x) \u2318h \u0000(y + x)\u0000(y)i. (32)\nNow consider a volumeV that is large enough to contain many representative statistically\nhomogenous and isotropic regions. We can imagine that each sub-volume ofV represents\na draw from the statistical properties of the universe, allowing us to replace the statistical\nensemble average above with a volume average\n\u21e0(x)= 1\nV\nZ\nd3y\u0000(y + x)\u0000(y). (33)\nUsing this relation we can arrive at a di\u21b5erent probabilistic interpretation of the correlation\nfunction \u21e0(x). Using the fact that\u0000 \u2318 (\u21e2 \u0000 \u00af\u21e2)/\u00af\u21e2 this equation becomes\n\u21e0(x)= 1\n\u00af\u21e22\nZ d3y\nV [\u21e2(y + x) \u0000 \u00af\u21e2][\u21e2(y) \u0000 \u00af\u21e2]= 1\n\u00af\u21e22\nZ d3y\nV \u21e2(y + x)\u21e2(y) \u0000 1, (34)\nwhere the last equality used the fact that the volume integral of\u21e2(y)i s\u00af \u21e2.I f w e d e \ufb01 n e t h e\nnew variablesu = y \u0000 x1 and x2 = x1 + x,w ec a nr e w r i t et h i se q u a t i o na s\nZ d3u\nV \u21e2(u + x1)\u21e2(u + x2)=\u00af \u21e22 [1 +\u21e0(|x1 \u0000 x2|)] . (35)\nIf \u21e2(x)r e p r e s e n t st h es m o o t hd e n s i t yo fs o m ec l a s so fo b j e c t s\u2013l i k eg a l a x i e s\u2013t h e nt h e\nprobability of \ufb01nding P12 two galaxies near each other with separation|x1 \u0000 x2| will be\nproportional to\nP12 /\nZ d3u\nV \u21e2(u + x1)\u21e2(u + x2) / \u00af\u21e22 [1 +\u21e0(|x1 \u0000 x2|)] . (36)\nIf these two events were independent, i..e if the existence of galaxy atx1 has no e\u21b5ect on\nthe probability of \ufb01nding a galaxy atx2, then the same probabiblityPind / \u00af\u21e22. Hence the\n8\nee\n\u2018excess\u2019 probability over random occurence of \ufb01nding a pair of galaxies separated by|x1 \u0000x2|\nis given by\nP12\nPind\n=1+ \u21e0(|x1 \u0000 x2|). (37)\nThe correlation function is therefore a direct measure of the excess probability over random of\n\ufb01nding two objects separated by|x1\u0000x2|. Alternatively stated, if we consider an in\ufb01nitesimal\nvolume element dV1 centered on position x1,a n ddV2 centered on position x2,t h e nt h e\nprobability of \ufb01nding a pair of objects with one object indV1 and the other indV2 is\ndP =\u00af \u21e22[1 +\u21e0(|x1 \u0000 x2|)]dV1dV2.

We\ncan generalize this de\ufb01nition and write\n\u0000MR(x)=\u00af \u21e2\nZ\n\u0000(x + y)W(y)d3y, (40)\nwhere W(y)i sa \ufb01lter or window function which has the property thatW(y) ' 1f o r\n|y| <R ,a n dW(y) ' 0f o r|y| >R .S o m e t i m e so n ep r e f e r st ou s eaw i n d o wf u n c t i o nt h a ti s\nsmoother than the top-hat (Heaviside) window function we used above. One such example\nis the Gaussian\nW(y)=e x p\n\u2713\n\u0000 y2\n2R2\n\u25c6\n. (41)\nNotice that the e\u21b5ect of the window function is to average out the \ufb02uctuations in\u0000(x)a t\nscales smaller thanR. This is clearly seen in the Fourier transform of eqn. (40)\n\u0000MR(k)=\u00af \u21e2W(k)\u0000(k)=( 2\u21e1)3/2R3\u0000(k)e x p\n\u2713\n\u0000 k2\n2(1/R)2\n\u25c6\n, (42)\nwhere in the last equality we plugged in the Fourier transformW(k)f o rt h eG a u s s i a n\ufb01 l t e r\nfunction in eqn.

Thus we see that our \ufb01lter is a low-pass \ufb01lter \u2014 the \ufb01lter function is\nvery smallW(k) \u2327 1f o rh i g h -k modes k \u0000 R\u00001 (i.e. for small wavelengths\u0000 =2 \u21e1/k \u2327 R),\nsuppressing them in the \ufb01ltered \ufb01eld\u0000MR.\nSince \u0000(x) is a Gaussian random \ufb01eld, so is\u0000MR.W ew o u l dl i k et oc o m p u t et h ev a r i a n c ei n\n9\nthe relative mass excess\n\u0000R(x) \u2318 \u0000MR\nMR\n, (43)\nwhich can be computed exactly once we de\ufb01ne the mean massMR inside of our \ufb01lter. For\nthe top-hat window functionW(y)=\u21e5 (R \u0000| y|) the mass contained inside the radiusR is\nclearly MR =( 4\u21e1/3)R3 \u00af\u21e2.F o r a G a u s s i a n w i n d o w f u n c t i o n t h e m a s s e n c l o s e d i s l e s s s c l e a r .\nAr e a s o n a b l ec h o i c ei st os i m p l yu s et h ev o l u m ee n c l o s e db yt h e\ufb01 l t e r\nMR \u2318 \u00af\u21e2\nZ\nd3yW(y)=( 2\u21e1)3/2R3 \u00af\u21e2 \u2318 VW \u00af\u21e2, (44)\nwhere VW is the e\u21b5ective volume of the Gaussian.

(47)\nAs we will see, although there are compelling theoretical arguments for the shape of the\npower spectrum of primordial density \ufb02uctuations in the Universe, the amplitude of these\ndensity \ufb02uctuations is not something that can be predicted ab initio by in\ufb02ationary theory.\nThus we have to resort to normalizing the power spectrum from observations. For historical\nreasons a common prescription for normalizing the linear theory power spectrum uses the\nvariance of the relative mass excess,\u0000R(x)i ns p h e r e so fr a d i u sR.I ft h en u m b e ro fg a l a x i e s\ntraces the mass, then this can be determined from the variance in the number of galaxies\nenclosed by randomly placed spheres with radiusR,w h i c hi ss e e nt od e p e n do nt h ep o w e r\nspectrum from eqn.

Indeed, the value of\u0000(R)d e r i v e df r o mt h ed i s t r i b u t i o n\nof galaxies is about unity forR =8 h\u00001 Mpc, where the strange h\u00001 units are a vestige\nof a time when the Hubble constant was poorly known2.T h e r e a r e s e v e r a l p r o b l e m s w i t h\nthis approach, namely since\u0000(R) \u21e0 1, one is not actually probing the linear regime where\n\u0000 \u2327 1. Second, normalizing based on galaxy counts assumes galaxies are perfect tracers of\n2Since all distances in cosmology depend on the Hubble constant, explicitly factoring it out of the distance\nunits in this way allowed people to compare results independent of assumptions about the speci\ufb01c value of\nthe Hubble constant.\n10\nthe \ufb02uctuations in the underlying dark matter distribution. Although people no longer use\nthe variance of galaxy counts to normalize the power spectrum, this convention of denoting\nthe normalization of the linear theory power spectrum with\u0000(8 h\u00001 Mpc) is still commonly\nused.\n11\nPhys 236: Cosmology\nLecture 10: In\ufb02ation\nSo far we have emphasized the successes of the standard Hot Big Bang model for the universe,\nbut it turns out that it also has some serious problems. The standard Big Bang theory\ndescribed in the previous lecutres is incomplete. Key features of the observed universe, such\nas its large-scale homogeneity and \ufb02atness, seem to require that the Universe started with\nvery special, \ufb01nely-tuned initial conditions. These initial conditions must be imposed by\nhand. In this lecture, we will learn how in\ufb02ation \u2013 an early period of accelerated expansion \u2013\ndrives the primordial Universe towards this special state, even if it started from more generic\ninitial conditions.\n1 Problems with the Hot Big Bang Model\n1.1 The Flatness Problem\nRecall the Friedmann equation\nH2(a)= 8\u21e1G\n3\n\u21e5\n\u21e2m0a\u00003 + \u21e2r0a\u00004 + \u21e2\u21e40\n\u21e4\n\u0000 kc2\nR2\n0a2 , (1)\nWe can rewrite this equation as\n1 \u0000 \u2326(t)= \u0000k\n\u2713c/H(t)\nR0a(t)\n\u25c62\n, (2)\nwhere\n\u2326(t) \u2318 \u21e2(t)\n\u21e2crit(t) = \u21e2r + \u21e2m + \u21e2vac\n\u21e2crit\n(3)\nand\n\u21e2crit(t)= 3H2(t)\n8\u21e1G . (4)\nNow to build intuition about the quantity 1\u0000 \u2326(t), recall our semi-classical derivation of\nthe Friedmann equation. Speci\ufb01cally, we considered a small spherical region of \ufb01xed mass\nM enclosed within a radius R,a n da r g u e dt h a tat e s tm a s sa tR would experience an\nacceleration\n\u00a8R = \u0000GM\nR2 , (5)\nwhich we then integrated once (\ufb01rst multiplying both sides by\u02d9R)t oo b t a i n\n1\n2\n\u02d9R2 \u0000 GM\nR = E\n1\n2\n\u02d9R2 \u0000 4\u21e1G\u21e2R2\n3 = E, (6)\n1\nwhere E was a constant of integration that we argued is the energy per unit mass of our test\nparticle. We then substitutedR = a(t)R0 and identi\ufb01ed E = \u0000kc2/2R2\n0 and arrived at the\nFriedmann equation above.\nThe three possible fates of this classical expanding sphere model of the universe are analogous\nto the three possible fates of a ball thrown upward from the surface of the Earth. If the ball\nis thrown upward with enough energy such that its speed is greater than the escape velocity\nit continues to in\ufb01nity. If thrown upward with less energy, it reaches a maximum altitude\nand then falls back down. Third and \ufb01nally, if the ball is thrown upward with exactly the\nright energy such that its speed equals the escape speed it reaches in\ufb01nity ast !1 .\nContinuing with this analogy, if we can evaluate 1\u0000 \u2326(t)a ta n yt i m e ,t h e nw ed e t e r m i n e\nthis \u2018energy\u2019 in the Friedmann equation, which is e\u21b5ectively like determining the initial\nconditions for the expansion.

Indeed, the \u2326 = 1 case is the analog of the ball thrown up atexactly\nthe escape velocity.\nWith this in mind, we can evaluate eqn.

Why should the radius of curvature be so large today so as to give a value of \u23260 so\nclose to unity? Indeed, following the discussion above, in GR the radius of curvatuve of the\nUniverse R0 is determined by its mass energy contents, and so the closeness of \u23260 to unity\namounts to some very \ufb01nely tuned initial condition,\n\u23260 =\u2326 r0 +\u2326 m0 +\u2326 vac0 =1 . (10)\nBut \u23260 could be any number like 106 or 10\u00006 without violating any law of physics.

(19)\nWhy should the initial energy contents conspire to be within one part in 1062 from the critical\ndensity? Indeed, our very existence depends on this seeming coincidence.

In\ufb02ation provides this mechanism.\n1.2 The Horizon Problem\nThe CMB is observed to be the same temperature in all directions to a precision of one part\nin \u21e0 105.T h i s f a c t e x p l a i n s w h y r e c o m b i n a t i o n a n d d e c o u p l i n g o c c u r a s a n a b r u p t p h a s e\ntransition, which in turn explains why the surface of last scattering is a thin surface, because\nall of the di\u21b5erent directions on the sky went through recombination and decoupling during\nthe same narrow time interval. Should we be surprised that this event was so synchronized,\nand that the CMB is isotropic? Careful re\ufb02ection upon these facts points to an apparent\nparadox.\nPreviously we learned about the the particle horizon, which is the largest comoving distance\nfrom which an observer at timet will be able to receive signals traveling at the speed of light\nrph(t)=\nZ t\n0\ncdt\na(t). (20)\nThe spacetime diagram in Fig. 1 shows our past light cone which intersects the surface of\nlast scattering atz ' 1100, and the Big Bang singularity atz = 1 or a =0 . C o n s i d e rt w o\nopposite directions on the sky. The CMB photons that we receive from these directions were\nemitted at the points labelledp and q in the \ufb01gure. The CMB that we observe coming from\nthese two points re\ufb02ects the temperature of the universe atz ' 1100 (and the anisotropies\nare sensitive to density and velocity \ufb02uctuations that existed at that time). We see that the\nphotons were emitted su\u0000ciently close to the Big Bang singularity that the past light cones\nof p and q don\u2019t overlap. This implies that no point lies inside the particle horizons of both\np and q. So the puzzle is: how do the photons coming fromp and q \u2018know\u2019 that they should\nbe at almost exactly the same temperature?\n4no canal contact\nFigure 1: Illustration of the horizon problem in the conventional Big Bang model. All events\nthat we currently observe are on our past light cone. The intersection of our past light cone\nwith the spacelike slice at the time of recombination is the surface of last-scattering. Points\nthat are separated by more than 2\u0000 on the sky seem never to have been in causal contact,\nsince their past light cones don\u2019t overlap. Figure from Baumann.\nTo understand how large the causally connected regions actually are, we will calculate the\nangular size of the particle horizon at the surface of last scattering. You did this calculation\nin the homework but let\u2019s go over it again. Recall that the particle horizon is a comoving\ndistance, but we would like a proper distance so that we can compute an angular size. If\n5\ndhor is the proper distance we desire attls then\ndhor = a(tls)rph(tls)= a(tls)\nZ tls\n0\ncdt\na(t) =0 .251 Mpc. (21)\nThe angular-diameter distance to the surface of last scattering isdA =1 2.8M p c ( t h i s s e e m s\ninsanely small since we usually think of cosmological distances as being in Gpc, but recall\nthat the angular diameter distance scales asdc(z)/(1 +z), and is not monotonic but rather\npeaks at z \u21e0 1a n dt h e nd e c r e a s e s ) ,s ot h e nt h ea n g u l a rs i z ei s\n\u2713hor = dhor(tls)\ndA(tls) \u21e1 0.251 Mpc\n12.8M p c\u21e1 1.1\u0000. (22)\nThus any two points in the CMB that are separated by more than roughly 2\u0000 on the sky\nare basically causally disconnected. There are ' 40, 000 deg2 in 4\u21e1 steradians, and so in\nfact the CMB is made up of about 104 di\u21b5erent causally disconnected regions of space. The\nhomogeneity of the CMB spans scales that are much larger than the particle horizon at the\ntime when the CMB was formed. The only way to explain its isotropy is to postulate that\nthese regions actually were somehow causally connected. In\ufb02ation also achieves this goal.\n1.3 The Monopole Problem\nThe electroweak theory by Weinberg, Salam, and Glashow successfully uni\ufb01es the electrog-\nmagnetic and weak forces at at\u21e0 1 TeV. In particle physics, a Grand Uni\ufb01ed Theory (GUT)\nis a \ufb01eld theory that attempts to unify the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force,\nand the strong nuclear force. By extrapolating the known properties of the strong and\nelectroweak forces to higher energies, particle physicists estimate that at an energy\nEGUT \u21e0 1012TeV \u21e0 10\u00004EPl\nTGUT \u21e0 1028 K\ntGUT \u21e0 10\u000036 s. (23)\nthe strong and electroweak forces should be uni\ufb01ed as a single grand uni\ufb01ed force. The GUT\nenergy is about about for orders of magnitude smaller than the Planck energy,EPl.\nIn GUT theories local symmetry under some simple symmetry group is spontaneously broken\naround the GUT energy to the gauge symmetry of the Standard Model under the group\nSU (3) \u21e5 SU (2) \u21e5 U(1). In all such cases, the scalar \ufb01elds that break the symmetry can\nbe left in twisted con\ufb01gurations that carry non-zero magnetic charge and that cannot be\nsmoothed out through any continuous processes. Thus GUT theories predict that the GUT\nphase transition creates point-like topological defects that act like magnetic monopoles. This\nposes a problem for comological models which is known as the \u2019Monopole Problem\u2019, because\nat the time of the GUT phase transition, points further apart than the horizon size at that\ntime will be out of causal contact with each other, and thus one expects one topological defect\nper horizon volume. This would then predict a large number density of magnetic monopoloes\nin the present day universe which are not observed. You will explore the monopole problem\n6\n4\nfurther on the homework. A phase of rapid expansion after the GUT phase transition would\nexpand the volume of the universe and dramatically lower the number density of monopoles\n\u2014t h i si sh o wi n \ufb02 a t i o ns o l v e st h em o n o p o l ep r o b l e m .\n2 The In\ufb02ation Solution\nIn\ufb02ation can most generally be de\ufb01ned as the hypothesis that there was a period early in the\nhistory of our universe when the expansion was accelerating; that is an epoch when \u00a8a> 0.\nConsider that at the relevant early times the energy density is dominated by a single energy\ncomponent with equation of state\nP = w\u21e2c2, (24)\nwe showed that the \ufb02uid equation\n\u02d9\u21e2 +3 \u02d9a\na (\u21e2 + w\u21e2)=0 , (25)\nimplies that\n\u21e2 / a\u00003(1+w). (26)\nPlugging into the acceleration equation we \ufb01nd that\n\u00a8a\na = \u00004\u21e1G\n3\n\u2713\n\u21e2 + 3P\nc2\n\u25c6\n= \u00004\u21e1G\n3 (1 + 3w)\u21e2. (27)\nThus ifw< \u00001/3 ! then \u00a8a> 0a n dt h ee x p a n s i o nw i l la c c e l e r a t e .\nWe can see how this solves the horizon problem as follows. The particle horizon can be\nwritten\nrph(t)=\nZ t\nti\ncdt\na =\nZ a\nai\ncda\na\u02d9a =\nZ ln a\nln ai\nc(aH)\u00001d ln a, (28)\nwhere ai \u2318 0c o r r e s p o n d st ot h eB i gB a n gs i n g u l a r i t y .T h i ss t a t e st h a tt h ec a u s a ls t r u c t u r e\nof the spacetime is related to the evolution of thecomoving Hubble radius, c(aH)\u00001.\nAssuming that the curvature term in the Friedmann equation is sub-dominant compared to\n\u21e2 at the early times in question we have\nH2 = 8\u21e1G\u21e2\n3 ) (aH)\u00001 = H\u00001\n0 a1\n2 (1+3w), (29)\nwhere we have chosen to normalize this expansion rate to the present valueH0 (or equiva-\nlently we chose to normalize the total energy density of dark energy\u21e2DE,0 at t = t0 to be\n\u21e2crit(t0)=3 H2\n0 /(8\u21e1G)). Carrying out the integral in eqn. (28) then gives\nrph(a)= 2cH\u00001\n0\n1+3 w\nh\na1\n2 (1+3w) \u0000 a\n1\n2 (1+3w)\ni\ni\n. (30)\nIt is thus apparent that for a \ufb02uid which satis\ufb01es 1+3w> 0o rw> \u00001/3, then the comoving\n7\n\u02c7\nparticle horizon receives its largest contribution from late times, since for the second term\nlimai!0\na\n1\n2 (1+3w)\ni =0 ( w> \u00001\n3)( 3 1 )\nHowever, forw< \u00001/3t h e nt h es e c o n dt e r md i v e r g e s\nlimai!0\na\n1\n2 (1+3w)\ni = 1 (w< \u00001\n3), ) rph(a) !1 .

This behavior is illustrated in Fig. 2.\nFigure 2: In\ufb02ationary solution to the horizon problem. The spacelike singularity of the stan-\ndard Big Bang is replaced by the reheating surface.

Figure from Baumann.\n8\n2.1 How Much In\ufb02ation is Needed?\nFor concreteness let\u2019s consider the simplest implementation of in\ufb02ation with a univese that\nwas dominated by something like a positive cosmological constant at early times \u21e4i (w = \u00001)\nwith energy density\u21e2i implying that\nH2\ni (a)= 8\u21e1G\n3 \u21e2\u21e4. (33)\nWe worked out earlier that this form of energy admits solutions for which the scale factor\ngrows exponentially with time\na(t) / eHit. (34)\nTo explore the impact of this exponential growth, let\u2019s assume that that the universe had\nap e r i o do fe x p o n e n t i a le x p a n s i o ns o m e t i m ei nt h em i d s to fi t se a r l yr a d i a t i o nd o m i n a t e d\nphase. For simplicity, imagine it switched on instantaneously at timeti,l a s t e du n t i ls o m e\nlater time tf when it shuts o\u21b5 instantaneously, and after the exponential growth shuts o\u21b5\nthe universe transitions to a state of radiation dominated expansion again. For this simple\ncase, we can write the scale factor as\na(t)=\n8\n<\n:\nai (t/ti)1/2 t<t i\naieHi(t\u0000ti) ti <t<t f\naieHi(tf \u0000ti) (t/tf )1/2 t>t f\n. (35)\nThus, between the timesti when in\ufb02ation began, and tf when it ended, the scale factor\nincreased by\na(tf )\na(ti) = eHi(tf \u0000ti) = eN , (36)\nwhere\nN \u2318 Hi(tf \u0000 ti). (37)\nWe thus see that if the duration, (tf \u0000 ti), of in\ufb02ation was long compared to the age of the\nUniverse at ti,w h i c hw a s\u21e0 H\u00001\ni ,t h e nN is large and the growth of the scale factor was\nenormous.\nLet\u2019s consider one possible model where the exponential in\ufb02ation starts around the GUT\nscale when the energy isEGUT \u21e0 1012 TeV which is when\nti = tGUT \u21e0 10\u000036 s, (38)\nimplying\nHi ' t\u00001\nGUT ' 1036 s\u00001 (39)\nwhere we have used the scaling betweenE / T / a\u00001 / t\u00001/2 for a radiation dominated\nuniverse to derivetGUT. After theseNe -foldings the timetf is then\ntf = N\nHi\n+ ti ' (N +1 )tGUT (40)\n9\nWe can now see how in\ufb02ation resolves the \ufb02atness problem. Recall our equation for 1\u0000\u2326(t)\n|1 \u0000 \u2326(t)| =\n\u2713c/H(t)\nR0a(t)\n\u25c62\n, (41)\nfor any universe that is not perfectly \ufb02at (k =0 ) .

(43)\nImagine that prior to in\ufb02ation the Universe was actually strongly curved\n|1 \u0000 \u2326(ti)|\u21e0 1. (44)\nAfter N e-foldings of in\ufb02ation, the deviation of \u2326 from unity would be\n|1 \u0000 \u2326(tf )|\u21e0 e\u00002N . (45)\nDuring the subsequent radiation-dominated and matter-dominated eras, the quantity|1\u0000\u2326|\nwould increase again (see eqn. (13)). But starting from the fact that today\n|1 \u0000 \u23260|\uf8ff 0.002, (46)\nwe can use the equation\n1 \u0000 \u2326(t)= H2\n0 (1 \u0000 \u23260)\nH2(t)a2(t) (47)\nto extrapolate back in time and determine how much inlation was needed to \ufb02atten the\nuniverse to be consistent with observed constraints.\nIf we approximate the universe as radiation dominated between the present epoch andtf\nthen at\ntf =( N +1 )tGUT =( N +1 )\u00b7 10\u000036 s( 4 8 )\nthe scale factor was\na(tf ) ' 2 \u21e5 10\u000028p\nN +1 , (49)\nwhere we used the expression derived in lecture4 for a radiation dominated Universe\na(t)=\n\u2713 t\nt0\n\u25c61/2\n, (50)\nwhere t0 =2 .4 \u21e5 1019 s=7 5 0 G y r .

(52)\nIf we equate this to our previous expression for the amount of \ufb02attening produced at the\nend of in\ufb02ation\n|1 \u0000 \u2326(tf )|\u21e0 e\u00002N , (53)\nwe obtain\ne\u00002N ' 10\u000054 \u00b7 (N +1 ) ) N '\u0000 ln 10\u000054\n2 ' 62. (54)\nThus the minimum number of e-foldings required to match the observation isN \u21e0 62 which\ncorresponds to an increase in the scale factor of\na(tf )\na(ti) \u21e0 e62 \u21e0 1027. (55)\nNote thatN may have actually been much greater than 62 since the constraint that we used\nfor 1\u0000 \u23260 was an upper limit on the deviation from observations, and the Universe could\nactually be much \ufb02atter than this.\nWe saw in eqn. (32) that accelerating expansionw< \u00001/3c a u s e st h ep a r t i c l eh o r i z o nt o\ndiverge as the Big Bang singularity is approached. This increase of the particle horizon has\nthe desired e\u21b5ect of putting antipodal points on the CMB into causal contact as illustrated\nin Fig. 2). For a model withN ' 65 e-foldings the particle horizon at the epoch of last\nscattering\ndhor(tls) \u21e0 200 Mpc (56)\nwhich is 800 times larger than the horizon sizedhor(tls) ' 0.25 Mpc that we calculated in the\nabsence of in\ufb02ation, and guarantees that antipodal points on the last scattering surface are\ncausally connected.\n2.2 Scalar Fields\nAs a simple toy model for in\ufb02ation we consider a scalar \ufb01eld\u0000(t, ~ x). As indicated by the\nnotation, the value of the \ufb01eld can depend on timet and the position in space~x. Associated\nwith each \ufb01eld value is a potential energy densityV (\u0000) (see Fig. 3). If the \ufb01eld is dynamical\n(i.e. changes with time) then it also carries kinetic energy density. In some early imple-\nmentations of in\ufb02ation this scalar \ufb01eld is associated with the Higgs \ufb01eld, which mediates\ninteractions between particles at energies higher than the GUT energy, but we will keep the\ndiscussion general and just refer to the scalr \ufb01eld\u0000 as thein\ufb02aton \ufb01eld,w h i c hh a su n i t so f\nenergy. If the stress-energy associated with the scalar \ufb01eld dominates the universe, it sources\nthe evolution of the FRW background. We want to determine under which conditions this\ncan lead to accelerated expansion.\n11\nFigure 3: Example of a slow-roll potential. In\ufb02ation occurs in the shaded parts of the\npotential. Figure from Baumann.\nIn quantum \ufb01eld theory one derives the stress-energy of a general scalar \ufb01eld via Noether\u2019s\ntheorem and the principle of least action\nT\u00b5\u232b = @\u00b5\u0000@\u232b\u0000 \u0000 g\u00b5\u232b\n\u27131\n2g\u21b5\u0000@\u21b5\u0000@\u0000\u0000 \u0000 V (\u0000)\n\u25c6\n. (57)\nConsistency with the symmetries of the FRW spacetime requires that the in\ufb02aton only\ndepends on time but not on spatial location1 \u0000 = \u0000(t). From the time-time component of\nthe stress-energy tensorT0\n0 = \u21e2\u0000, we infer that the energy density\n\u21e2\u0000 =\nkinetic\nz }| {\n1\n2\n\u02d9\u00002\n~c3 + V (\u0000)| {z }\npotential\n.

(59)\nRight away we see that if the in\ufb02aton \ufb01eld changes only very slowly as a function of time\n\u02d9\u00002 \u2327 ~c3V (\u0000), (60)\nthen the potential energy dominates over the kinetic energy and the in\ufb02aton \ufb01eld behaves\nlike a cosmological constant\nP\u0000 \u21e1\u0000 \u21e2\u0000 \u21e1\u0000 V (\u0000).

Thus the scalar \ufb01eld energy can drive exponential in\ufb02ation if there is a temporary\nperiod when its rate of change\u02d9\u0000 is small, and its potential energy large enough to dominate\nthe energy density of the universe.\nNext we determine under what set of circumstances the conditions for in\ufb02ation (\u02d9\u00002 \u2327\n~c3V (\u0000)) are met in the early universe. Writing the \ufb02uid equation for the energy density of\nthe in\ufb02aton \ufb01eld,\n\u02d9\u21e2\u0000 +3 H(t)(\u21e2\u0000 + P\u0000)=0 ( 6 3 )\nand combining with the expressions for\u21e2\u0000 and P\u0000 above we arrive at a simple equation for\nthe time evolution of the in\ufb02aton \ufb01eld\n\u00a8\u0000 +3 H(t) \u02d9\u0000 = \u0000~c3 dV\nd\u0000 , (64)\nwhich is known as the Klein-Gordon equation.\nNote that the Klein-Gordon equation mimics the equation of motion of a particle with\ndisplacement \u0000 accelerated by a force proportional to the gradient of the in\ufb02aton potential\ndV/d\u0000,b u ts u b j e c t e dt oaf r i c t i o n a lf o r c e3H \u02d9\u0000 which is proportional to the particles speed\n\u02d9\u0000.T h u s , t h e e x p a n s i o n o f t h e u n i v e r s e r e s u l t s i nHubble dragwhich slows the transition\nof the in\ufb02aton \ufb01eld to a value that will minimize its potentialV (\u0000).\nThis implies that the in\ufb02aton \ufb01eld can reach aterminal velocity, where Hubble drag balances\nthe \u2018force\u2019 from the potential and thus\u00a8\u0000 =0 ,w h i c hi sw h e n\n3H \u02d9\u0000 = \u0000~c3 dV\nd\u0000 ) \u02d9\u0000 = \u0000~c3\n3H\ndV\nd\u0000 (65)\n13\n\u02c7\nIf the in\ufb02aton is moving at this terminal velocity, then the condition that\n\u02d9\u00002 \u2327 ~c3V )\n\u2713dV\nd\u0000\n\u25c62\n\u2327 9H2V\n~c3 , (66)\nwhich is a condition on the steepness of the in\ufb02aton potential.

The\nin\ufb02aton slowly rolls down the shallow potential towards its true minimum energy, and the\ntime spent on this plateau sources the accelerating expansion of the universe forNe -foldings\nof the scale factor causing the universe to grow by a tremendous amount.\n14\nPhys 236: Cosmology\nLecture 12-13: Linear Structure Formation\nNow that we have established how to statistically describe density \ufb02uctuations in the universe\nwe will study how some initial set of \ufb02uctuations grow and evolve with time because of grav-\nitational instability. In its full generality this is a very complex and technical task. There are\nseveral reasons for this complexity. First, the di\u21b5erential equations that describe structure\nformation are non-linear which means that they will not admit simple analytical solutions,\nand furthermore the systems evolve chaotically. The remedy for this is straighforward \u2013 one\ncan always resort to numerical calulations.\nNon-linear evolution is however unfortunately not the only complication. To fully solve for\nthe evolution of structure Newtonian gravity will not su\u0000ce, and one needs to use the full\nmachinery of general relativity. There are several reasons for this. The \ufb01rst is that, as we\nlearned beore, all forms of mass energy can gravitate, and so to properly treat \ufb02uctuations\nin the relativistic components we need GR. Even more subtle and complicated are issues\nrelated to causality and the presence of horizons, which clearly requires GR since Newtonian\ngravity would imply action-at-a-distance. Although Newtonian analysis provides valuable\ninsight into the behavior of inhomogeneities, it su\u21b5ers from the following di\u0000culty. As we\nwill learn, at su\u0000ciently early epochs the wavelengths\u0000 of density \ufb02uctuation modes that\nwe will need to consider will lie outside of the particle horizonrph. Newtonian analysis is\nonly valid for later times when the wavelengths of the \ufb02uctuations are much smaller than the\nparticle horizon \u0000 \u2327 rph.T h u s t h e e a r l y e v o l u t i o n o fany mode needs to be tackled using\nthe full machinery in GR.\nOne of the main challenges with studying the growth of inhomogenities in GR is the question\nof gauge freedom. Qualitatively, you can think of the choice of a gauge as choosing a\ncoordinate system. For modes much smaller than the horizon, there exists a natural choice\nof coordinates in which GR looks like Newtonian gravity, adhering to our physical intuition.\nHowever, for super-horizon modes this is not the case, and for technical reasons one cannot\nwork in this quasi-Newtonian gauge. These gauge/coordinate ambiguities make the full\ntreatment in GR a rather daunting task.\nThe full GR treatment is thus beyond the scope of this course. In this set of lectures we will\nrestrict attention to the Newtonian treatment in the linear regime\u0000(x) \u2327 1, which allows us\nto linearize the di\u21b5erential equations, allowing us to obtain analytical results in a few cases.\nIn a future lecture, we will discuss evolution of density \ufb02uctuations in the non-linear regime.\n1 Jeans Instability\nBefore treating an expanding universe, let\u2019s start by building our intuition by studying\nthe growth of preturbations due to gravitational instability in a static nonexpanding uni-\nverse. Thus we consider a homogenous isotropic background density of matter with time-\n1\nindependent density\u21e20(r,t )=c o n s t. The evolution equations for a perfect \ufb02uid are\n@\u21e2\n@t + r\u00b7 (\u21e2v)=0 ( c o n t i n u i t y ) ( 1 )\n@v\n@t +( v \u00b7r )v = \u0000rP\n\u21e2 \u0000r \u0000( E u l e r ) ( 2 )\nr2\u0000=4 \u21e1G\u21e2 (Poisson). (3)\nThese equations express conservation of mass-energy (continuity), conservation of momen-\ntum (Euler), and gravity (Poisson), respectively. They amount to \ufb01ve equations in six\nunknowns (\u21e2, v, P, \u0000), so they must be supplemented by another equation. Similar to our\nderivation of the Friedmann equation, we must supplement these equations with an equation\nof stateP = P(\u21e2). Actually the most general form would be to assumeP = P(\u21e2, S), where\nS is the entropy, but we will assume the entropy is \ufb01xed,\u0000S =0 ,w h i c hi st os a yw ew i l l\nonly consider isentropic perturbations1 .\nWe consider small perturbations about a homogenous solution\n\u21e2(r,t )= \u21e20 + \u0000\u21e2(r,t )\nP(r,t )= P0 + \u0000P (r,t )\nv(r,t )= v0 + \u0000v = \u0000v(r,t )\n\u0000(r,t )=\u0000 0 + \u0000\u0000(r,t ), (4)\nwhere the terms with zero subscript are constants, we have assumedv0 = 0, and\u0000\u21e2 \u2327 \u21e20,\netc. Using the equation of state, the pressure perturbation can be written\n\u0000P = c2\ns\u0000\u21e2, c 2\ns \u2318\n\u2713@P\n@\u21e2\n\u25c6\nS\n(5)\nwhere cs is the sound speed.\nNote that as constructed this set of equations has some serious problems. If the \ufb02uid is to\nremain homogenous with constant density\u21e2 then we must also haveF /r \u00000 =0 ,o re l s e\nthere would be a net gravitational force. But this implies thatr2\u00000 =4 \u21e1G\u21e20 =0a sw e l l ,s o\nthe gas is not actually there! This means that there can be no homogenous self-gravitating\n\ufb02uid in equilibrium. For now we will simply ignore this complication and assume that such\nas o l u t i o nw i t hr2\u00000 =4 \u21e1G\u21e20 does exist, since it turns out to give a useful physical picture\nanyway. This is what is commonly referred to as theJeans swindle.\nSubstituting eqns. (4) into the continuity equation (eqn. 1) and gathering terms that are\n1Entropy perturbations can occur only in multi-component \ufb02uids. For example, in a \ufb02uid consisting of\nbaryons and radiation, the baryons can be distributed inhomogeneously on a homogeneous background of\nradiation. In such a case, the entropy, which is equal to the number of photons per baryon, varies from place\nto place. In general there are two types of perturbations \u2013 isentropic perturbations for which\u0000S = 0 (and\n\u0000\u21e2 6= 0), and so-called isocurvature pertubrations, which have\u0000\u21e2 =0( \u0000S 6= 0).\n2\nzeroth, \ufb01rst, and second-order in products of perturbed quantities gives\n@\u21e20\n@t + r\u00b7 (\u21e20v0)\n| {z }\n0th-order\n+ @\u0000\u21e2\n@t + r\u00b7 (\u21e20\u0000v)+ r\u00b7 (\u0000\u21e2v0)\n| {z }\n1st-order\n+ r\u00b7 (\u0000\u21e2\u0000v)| {z }\n2nd-order\n. (6)\nHere the 0th-order terms concern the homogenous unperturbed universe. In this static case\nthey are trivially zero, since we have assumed a constant background, but in the future when\nwe perturb about an expanding homogeneous and isotropic background they will be satis\ufb01ed\nby the unperturbed (zero subscript) terms. Keeping only linear order in perurbed quantities,\nthat is, ignoring the second order terms, we obtain for the perturbed continuity equation\n@\u0000\u21e2\n@t + \u21e20r\u00b7 \u0000v, (7)\nwhere we used the fact thatv0 = 0. Applying this same procedure to all of the \ufb02uid equations\nin eqns.

For \ufb02uctuations larger\nthan this maximum distance\u0000>\u0000 J (k<k J ), pressure cannot react quickly enough and\nthe mode is unstable to gravitational collapse. For shorter wavelengths,\u0000<\u0000 J (k>k J )\npressure can react, and a pressure gradient is created which then counteracts collapse and\ninstead gives rise to acoustic oscillations.

In an\nexpanding homogenous and isotropic universe, the background energy density is a function\nof time, and the background velocities obey the Hubble law. At the beginning of the course\nwe derived the Friedmann equations from Newtonian mechanics by considering a uniform\nexpanding ball of \ufb02uid. Here we repeat this analysis but now from the perspective of the\n\ufb02uid equations. Without perturbations we have\n\u21e2 = \u21e20(t)a n d v = v0 = H(t)r.

(23)\nThis just states that the total mass-energy of non-relativistic matter is conserved.

Whereas in the static\nuniverse \ufb02uctuations grow exponentially on the gravitational free-fall timescale, we see here\nthat instead the perturbation amplitude increases only as a power of time.\n2.4 Comparison to the CMB Anisotropy Level\nCMB anisotropy measurements probe temperature \ufb02uctuations which result from \ufb02uctua-\ntions in the radiation energy density\u21e2r / T4,t h u s\n\u0000\u21e2r\n\u21e2r\n=4 \u0000T\nT .

We just learned that in a matter dominated universe, which\nis a good description of the universe prior to very recently (i.e. prior tozm\u21e4 ' 0.3), that\n\ufb02uctuations larger than the Jeans scale\u0000J grow proportional to the scale factor, thus we\nexpect\n\u0000b(t0) \u21e0 a(t0)\na(tdec)\u0000b(tdec)=( 1+ zdec)\u0000b(tdec) \u21e0 1100 \u21e5 10\u00005 \u21e0 10\u00002.

Where did we go wrong?\nWell there are a couple of important complications that we have ignored:\n1. Nature of the perturbed component. The universe is made up of collisionless\ndark matter (cold, warm, hot?), baryons, and radiation. Our estimate above for the\n\ufb02uctuations from the CMB was based on using the CMB as a proxy for the baryonic\ncomponent. The \ufb02uctuations in the underlying dark matter were much larger than\n10\u00005 at decoupling explaining how we get large\u0000(R =8 h\u00001 Mpc) ' 1t o d a y . T h i si s\nactually one of the strongest pieces of evidence for dark matter.\n2. Species which dominates the energy densityThe expansion of the universe pow-\ners the Hubble drag term in eqn. 50, which opposes gravitational instability. We saw\nthat in the the matter dominated case expansion reduces the perturbation growth rate\nfrom exponential (static universe) to power law (expanding universe). We thus expect\nthat if other energy components (radiation, dark energy) dominate the expansion rate\nrelative to the component experiencing gravitational collapse (matter), that the growth\nof perturbations will slow down.\n3 Coupled Perturbations\nIf the energy density is comprised of a sum of contributions from di\u21b5erent components\n\u21e2 =\nX\ni\n\u21e2i, (67)\nwhere e.g. i=baryons, dark matter, photons, neturinos, etc., then the equation describing\nthe evolution of the perturbation\u0000i in the non-relativistic componenti is\n\u00a8\u0000i +2 H \u02d9\u0000i = \u0000c2\nsik2\na2 \u0000i +4 \u21e1G\nh X\nj\n\u21e2j\u0000j\n| {z }\nnon-relativistic\n+\nX\nk\n2\u21e2k\u0000k\n| {z }\nrelativistic\ni\n.

(69)\nThese modi\ufb01cations can be derived using special relativistic \ufb02uid mechanics and Newtownian\ngravity. The sound speed for a relativistic \ufb02uid iscs = c/\np\n3f o l l o w sf r o mt h ef a c tt h a t\n11\nP = \u21e2c2/3, which explains the pressure term for the relativistic component.

Radiation-matter equality occurs\nprior to decoupling, and the baryons and the photons will be tightly coupled together in a\nphoton-baryon \ufb02uid with a sound speed that is very close to the speed of light, whereas\nthe dark matter is an independent collisionless matter component which only interacts with\nthe photon-baryon \ufb02uid gravitationally. The main point to note is that the \ufb02uctuations\nin this photon-baryon \ufb02uid should be very small inside of the particle horizon, in other\nwords, according to eqn. (69), for scales below\u0000J \u21e0 cH\u00001. Sub-Jeans radiation \ufb02uctuations\ntherefore oscillate as sound waves and their time-averaged density contrast vanishes. To\ndescribe these \ufb02uctuations on the horizon scale properly GR is actually required. As such,\ntypically when using the Newtonian equations above, one restricts attention to scales well\nwithin the horizon\u0000 \u2327 cH\u00001. This means we can can assume the relativistic components\nhave zero \ufb02uctuations\u0000i ' 0. In this limit the equation describing the CDM \ufb02uctuations\u0000c\nbecomes\n\u00a8\u0000c +2 H \u02d9\u0000c =4 \u21e1G\u21e2c\u0000c, (70)\nwhere thec2\nsk2/a2 term now vanishes because CDM is a collisionless matter component which\ndoes not experience pressure forces (i.e.cs =0 ) . T h i se q u a t i o ni si d e n t i c a lt oe q n .( 5 8 )e x c e p t\nthat now we are not matter dominated. When the universe is radiation dominated\nH = 1\n2t; H2 = 8\u21e1G\n3 (\u21e2r + \u21e2c) \u21e1 8\u21e1G\u21e2r\n3 , (71)\nwhere in the last equality we assumed\u21e2r \u0000 \u21e2c since we are radiation dominated. Note also\nthat the \ufb01rst two terms in eqn. (70)\n\u00a8\u0000c \u21e0 2H \u02d9\u0000c \u21e0 H2\u0000c (72)\nsince the only timescale in the problem is the Hubble time (if pressure forces were relevant\nthe other relevant timescale would be the sound crossing time\u0000/cs,b u tw eh a v ea s s u m e d\ncollisionless dark matter). But since\n4\u21e1G\u21e2c \u2327 4\u21e1G\u21e2r \u21e0 H2, (73)\nwe can neglect the term on the right-hand side of eqn. (70) relative to the other two terms.\nIn other words\n\u00a8\u0000c + 1\nt\n\u02d9\u0000c \u21e1 0., (74)\nThe solution to this equation is\n\u0000c(t)= \u0000c(ti)\n\uf8ff\n1+ A ln\n\u2713 t\nti\n\u25c6\u0000\n, (75)\n12\nthus only a solution with an initial \u201cvelocity\u201d,\u02d9\u0000(ti) 6=0 ,c a na c t u a l l yg r o w( s ot h a tA 6=0 ) ,\nand only logarithmically at that. This suppression of the growth of \ufb02uctuations on scales\ninside the photon-baryon \ufb02uid sound horizon during radiation domination is known as the\nMeszaros e\u21b5ect. It says that, at early times, the dominant energy of radiation drives the\nuniverse to expand so fast that the collisionless matter, whose gravity is sub-dominant, has\nno time to respond, and\u0000 grows at most only logarithmically. At late times, the radiation\neventually becomes negligible, and the growth of perturbations increases smoothly to the\nEinstein-de Sitter \u0000 / a(t) behavior that we derived earlier.\n3.2 Late-Time Suppression of Structure Formation by\u21e4\nAnalogous to the Meszaros e\u21b5ect is a similar suppression of perurbation growth at late times\nwhen the Universe becomes cosmological constant dominated. Indeed, this is more relevant\nto the future since we showed that the epoch of matter-\u21e4 equality iszm\u21e4 ' 0.3. In this limit\nthe equation governing CDM perturbations is\n\u00a8\u0000c +2 H\u21e4 \u02d9\u0000c \u21e1 0, (76)\nwhere the Hubble parameter has the constant valueH = H\u21e4 and we have assumed that we\nare dark energy dominated\n4\u21e1G\u21e2c \u2327 4\u21e1G\u21e2\u21e4 \u21e0 H2\n\u21e4. (77)\nThis equation has solutions of the form\n\u0000c(t)= C1 + C2e\u00002H\u21e4t, (78)\nthus we see that \u21e4 suppresses the growth of structure. There is only a decaying mode, and\na constant mode, but not a growing mode. As such, the \ufb02uctuations in the matter density\nreach a constant fractional amplitude.\nWe have thus seen how linear perturbations grow when the universe is Einstein-De Sitter\nand \u21e4 dominated. In general, we write the growing mode solution as\n\u0000c(t) / D(a), (79)\nwhere D(a)i st h el i n e a rg r o w t hf u n c t i o n ,w h i c hh a st ob es o l v e df o rn u m e r i c a l l y .\n3.3 Baryons and DM Before and After Decoupling\nNow let\u2019s consider this same mix of photons, baryons, and CDM butafter matter radiation\nequality when the Universe is matter dominated. But now let\u2019s consider the \ufb02uctuations in\nthe photon-baryon \ufb02uid. The equations governing these coupled perturbations are\n\u00a8\u0000c +2 H \u02d9\u0000c =4 \u21e1G(\u21e2c\u0000c + \u21e2b\u0000b) \u21e1 4\u21e1G\u21e2c\u0000c (80)\n\u00a8\u0000b +2 H \u02d9\u0000b = \u0000 c2\nsk2\na2 +4 \u21e1G(\u21e2c\u0000c + \u21e2b\u0000b) \u21e1\u0000 c2\nsk2\na2 +4 \u21e1G\u21e2c\u0000c, (81)\n13\nwhere in the last equality we have assumed that the dark matter dominates the matter\ncontent. Since the dark matter dominates the gravity and the expansion rate, and we are\nEinstein-de Sitter and matter dominated, eqn. (80) for the dark matter yields the growing\nsolution \u0000 / a(t)w h i c hw es t u d i e db e f o r e . T h u st h e4\u21e1G\u21e2c\u0000c in the baryon evolution\nequation can be thought of as an external driving term. Given the pressure term in the\nevolution equation for the baryons and the fact that the Jeans scale\u0000J ' csH\u00001 \u21e0 cH\u00001 is\ncomparable to the horizon size, nearly all modes inside the horizon havek \u0000 kJ (\u0000 \u2327 \u0000J ).\nThus the high-sound speed causes the baryons to evolve di\u21b5erently than the dark matter,\nnamely the baryons will experience slowly declining sound waves\n\u0000b / 1\n(acs)1/2 exp\n\uf8ff\n\u00b1ik\nZ csdt\na(t)\n\u0000\n. (82)\nThese are the acoustic oscillations that give rise to the peaks in the CMB and the baryon\nacoustic oscillation signature in the dark matter power spectrum (via the small-back reaction\nof the baryons on the dark matter, which we have above ignored). Since some of these are\nlarge-scale horizon size modes, and since the baryons and photons are tightly coupled into a\nsingle \ufb02uid, typically one resorts to GR to solve this problem correctly.\nNow let\u2019s examine what happens after decoupling. As you will show in the homework, the\nsound speed of the baryons drops precipitously, and now the Jeans scale of the baryons is\nextremely small, about comparable to the mass of a globular cluster. We can thus now\nconsider the coupled perturbations, but ignore the pressure term\n\u00a8\u0000c +2 H \u02d9\u0000c \u21e1 4\u21e1G\u21e2c\u0000c (83)\n\u00a8\u0000b +2 H \u02d9\u0000b \u21e1 4\u21e1G\u21e2c\u0000c. (84)\nWe know that the solution for the dark matter growth has the solution\n\u0000c =( c o n s t a n t )a \u2318 \u21b5a. (85)\nSubstituting this result into eqn. (84) for the baryon evolution, we can write it as\na3/2 d\nda\n\u2713 1\na1/2\nd\u0000b\nda\n\u25c6\n+2 d\u0000b\nda = 3\n2\u21b5, (86)\nwhere we have assumed an Einstein-de Sitter matter dominated universe witha / t2/3.T h i s\nequation has the growing solution\n\u0000b = \u21b5(a \u0000 a0)= \u0000c(a)\n\u2713\n1 \u0000 C\na\n\u25c6\n, (87)\nwhere C is some constant. This solution thus shows that\u0000b ! \u0000c for a \u0000 C,e v e ni ff o r\nexample \u0000b \u21e1 0a ts o m ea = C = adec.I n o t h e r w o r d s ,b a r y o n i c p e r t u r b a t i o n s q u i c k l y \u2018 c a t c h\nup\u2019 with dark matter preturbations after decoupling. This in turn allows us to understand\nhow the \ufb02uctuations in the baryons can be so small\u0000b \u21e0 \u0000T/T \u21e0 10\u00005 at decoupling,\nas implied by the CMB anisotropy level, but nevertheless grow to form large non-linear\n14\nstructures today. Whereas baryons are coupled to the photons prior to decoupling and\nthus have a horizon size Jeans scale (gigantic Jeans mass), the dark matter only interacts\ngravitationally and \ufb02uctuations have been growing all along.\n4 Understanding the Power Spectrum\nIn\ufb02ation predicts a nearly scale invariant power spectrum which can be quanti\ufb01ed in terms\nof the rms \ufb02uctuations\u00002 of the Newtonian gravitational potential, in other words at some\ninitial time ti when the \ufb02uctuations were put in place\n\u00002\n\u0000(k,t i) \u2318 d\u00002(\u0000)\nd ln k = k3\n2\u21e12 P\u0000(k,t i)=c o n s t a n t) P\u0000(k,t i) / k\u00003. (88)\nFrom the perturbed Poisson\u2019s equationr2\u0000\u0000=4 \u21e1Ga2\u21e20\u0000, so in Fourier space we get\nk2\u0000\u0000= \u00004\u21e1Ga2\u21e20\u0000 ) P\u0000 / k4P\u0000(k) ) P\u0000(k) / k, (89)\nthus in\ufb02ation predictsP(k) / kn with n ' 1. Comparing this to the matter power spectrum,\nwe see that on large scales,k \u2327 kpeak ' 0.06 Mpc\u00001, P(k) / k as expected, but on small\nscales, k \u0000 kpeak, P(k) / k\u00003, seemingly violating the prediction from in\ufb02ation. How can\nwe understand the shape of the power spectrum?\n4.1 Super-Horizon Growth of Perturbations\nOur treatment thus far has been purely Newtonian which is an action-at-a-distance theory.\nAs such it cannot deal with the fact that in an expanding spacetime there exist particle\nhorizons that limit the distance between causally connected regions of the universe. In\ufb02ation\ncreates perturbations on all scales including super-horizon scales. Fluctuations that were\ngenerated during in\ufb02ation are constantly entering the horizon as the universe expands. This\nnotion of super-horizon \ufb02uctuations is necessary to understand the peak in the matter power\nspectrum, P(k), and why it deviates from the scale invariant prediction from in\ufb02ationP(k) /\nk on small scales. Only GR can properly treat the evolution of \ufb02uctuations comparable or\ngreater than the horizon scale. This is beyond the scope of this course so we will instead\nproceed heuristically. First, let\u2019s review what we know about horizons.\n4.1.1 Horizons\nPreviously we showed that if the the energy density is dominated by a single energy compo-\nnent with equation of statew such that the pressure is\nP = w\u21e2c2, (90)\nthen the \ufb02uid equation implies that\n\u21e2 / a\u00003(1+w), (91)\n15\nand the Friedmann equation (ignoring curvature) then reads\nH2 = 8\u21e1G\u21e2\n3c2 ) (aH)\u00001 = H\u00001\n0 a(1+3w)/2, (92)\nsuch that the comoving particle horizon is\ndph(a)=\nZ t\nti\ncdt\na =\nZ a\nai\nda\na\u02d9a =\nZ ln a\nln ai\n(aH)\u00001d ln a = 2cH\u00001\n0\n1+3 w\nh\na(1+3w)/2 \u0000 a(1+3w)/2\ni\ni\n. (93)\nPreviously we argued that in\ufb02ation causes the horizon to diverge solving the horizon problem.\nHere we are interested in understanding the evolution of density \ufb02uctuations that were put\nin place by in\ufb02ation, soai is here some very small scale factor after in\ufb02ation. This implies\nthe ai term in the equation above is basically zero, and we have\ndph(a)= 2cH\u00001\n0\n1+3 wa(1+3w)/2. (94)\nThe particle horizon is a comoving distance, but for the moment, let\u2019s consider the proper\nparticle horizon at this scale factora\nrph(a)= adph(a)= 2cH\u00001\n0\n1+3 wa3(1+w)/2 (95)\nNote however that for this same model of a single energy component dominating the energy\ncontents of the Universe, we showed in lecture4 that\na / t 2\n3(1+w) , (96)\nand thus\n2H\u00001\n0\n3(1 +w)a3(1+w)/2 = t, (97)\nor\nrph(t)= (1 +w)3ct\n1+3 w . (98)\nFor a matter dominated universe (w =0 ) ,rph(t)=3 ct,w h e r e a sf o rr a d i a t i o nd o m i n a t i o n\n(w =1 /3), rph(t)=2 ct.T h u st h ep r o p e rp a r t i c l eh o r i z o ni sa l w a y so fo r d e rrph(t) \u21e0 ct.\nNow consider how the proper size\u0000prop of a perturbation with comoving wavelength\u0000 evolves\nwith time. We know that\u0000prop = a(t)\u0000,a n dg i v e nt h es c a l i n gf o ra(t)i m p l i e db ye q n .( 9 7 )\nwe see that\nrph =2 ct; \u0000prop = a(t)\u0000 / t1/2\u0000;r a d i a t i o n d o m i n a t e d\nrph =3 ct; \u0000prop = a(t)\u0000 / t2/3\u0000;m a t t e r d o m i n a t e d. (99)\nThus the proper size of a comoving perturbation\u0000 has a shallower time evolution than the\nproper particle horizonrph. This faster evolution of the horizon size means that modes which\nare initially outside of the horizon will at some time enter the horizon as the universe expands\n16\nbecause the horizon grows faster and catches up with the proper scale. This is illustrated in\nFig. 1.\nFigure 1: A \ufb02uctuation which is superhorizon scale at matter-radiation equality grows always,\nwhile a \ufb02uctuation which enters the horizon during the radiation dominated era stops growing\nin amplitude until the matter dominated era begins. Figure from Norman arxiv e-print\n1005.1100.\n4.1.2 Sub-Horizon Growth Rates\nThe reason why this notion of horizon entry is so important is that modes evolve di\u21b5erently\noutside of the horizon than they do when they are inside the horizon. Let\u2019s \ufb01rst recap how\nsub-horizon density perturbations grow and also consider how the gravitational potential\nevolves. We will restrict attention to the cold dark matter, which means we can ignore the\ne\u21b5ect of free-streaming, which we will discuss next. From our perturbation theory analyses we\nlearned that sub-horizon modes grow as the scale factor during matter domination\u0000 / a(t),\nbut grow at most logarithmically\u0000 / ln a(t)d u r i n gr a d i a t i o nd o m i n a t i o n( t h eMezsaros\ne\u21b5ect):\n\u0000(k,t )= \u0000(k,t i)\n(\nln [a(t)/ai]r a d i a t i o n d o m i n a t e d\na(t)/ai matter dominated (100)\n17\nNow consider the graviational potential perturbation\u0000\u0000(x,t ), which we can write\n\u0000\u0000(x,t )=\nZ d3k\n(2\u21e1)3 \u0000\u0000(k,t )eik\u00b7x, (101)\nThe perturbed Poisson equation can be written ink-space as\nr2\u0000\u0000=4 \u21e1Ga2\u21e20\u0000 )\u0000 k2\u0000\u0000(k,t )=4 \u21e1Ga2\u21e20\u0000(k,t ) ) \u0000\u0000(k,t ) / \u0000(k,t )\u21e20(a)a2.\n(102)\nAccordingly, the sub-horizon evolution of the potential perturbation obeys\n\u0000\u0000(k,t )= \u0000\u0000(k,t i)\n(\n(a/ai)\u00002 radiation dominated\nconstant matter dominated , (103)\nwhere we used the scalings in eqn. (100) for\u0000(k,t )a n di g n o r e dt h el o g a r t h m i cd e p e n d e n c e\nduring radiation domination given that is multiplied by a steepera\u00002 time evolution. Thus\nthe potential perturbations decay asa\u00002 during radiation domination because of the Mezsaros\ne\u21b5ect, but are \u201cfrozen in\u201d at a constant during matter domination.\n4.1.3 Super-Horizon Growth Rates\nCrudely speaking, a super-horizon perturbation\u0000prop >r ph doesn\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d it is a perturba-\ntion as it has no causal knowledge of the metric on scales larger than itself. It is essentially\nan island universe which evolves independently of the regions it is causally disconnected\nfrom. In GR perturbation theory, the gravitational potential of these \ufb02uctuations is the\nperturbation to the metric. The upshot is that these super-horizon metric perturbations do\nnot evolve, they are frozen in and thus we have the result that for these modes the potential\nperturbation is constant in time. Hence for modes with\nk<k H \u2318 2\u21e1\ndph\n) \u0000\u0000(k,t )= \u0000\u0000(k), (104)\nis constant in time.\nFrom Poisson\u2019s equation ink-space (see eqn. (102))\n\u0000k2\u0000\u0000(k)=4 \u21e1Ga2\u21e20(t)\u0000(k,t ) ) \u0000(k,t ) / constant\n\u21e20a2 . (105)\nThus for the growth rate of super-horizon density \ufb02uctuations we have that\n\u0000(k,t )= \u0000(k,t i)\n(\n(a/ai)2 radiation dominated\na/ai matter dominated (106)\nWe now begin to better understand why we need to keep track of when modes enter the\nhorizon. As shown in Fig. 1, small-scale modes will enter the horizon at early times when the\nuniverse is radiation dominated, at which point their density will stop growing (actually it\n18\nTable 1: Growth Rates of Density Perturbations\nradiation dominated matter dominated\n\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\nsub-horizon a\u00002 ln a constant a\nsuper-horizon constant a2 constant a\ncan grow up to logarithmically depending on initial conditions, but just assume it is constant\nfor now), and its potential will decay asa\u00002,b e c a u s eo ft h eM e z s a r o se \u21b5 e c t . L a r g e rs c a l e\nmodes which cross the horizon later during matter domination never go through this phase\nof stunted growth rate or equivalently potential decay. The di\u21b5erent growth rates for sub-\nhorizon and super-horizon \ufb02uctuations in the potential,\u0000\u0000, and density\u0000,f o rr a d i a t i o na n d\nmatter dominated universes are summarized in Table 1.\n4.2 Understanding the Power Spectrum Shape\nWe have now put the pieces together necessary to understand how the linear theory power\nspectrum gets its shape. There are two important things to highlight before we proceed.\nMuch easier to work with potential \ufb02uctuations\u0000\u0000 In terms of how the perturbations\nevolve in the di\u21b5erent regimes, i.e. sub-horizon vs. super-horizon and radiation vs. matter\ndominated, it is clearly much easier to work with the potential, since Table 1, indicates that\nthe potential \ufb02uctuation basically remains constant in time in all but one case, sub-horizon\n\ufb02uctuations in a radiation dominated universe, where we see that it decays asa\u00002 due to\nthe Mezsaros e\u21b5ect.\nHorizon at Matter Radiation EqualityIt is clear that the comoving particle horizon at\nmatter-radiation equality,deq \u2318 dph(aeq), is an important physical scale. Because the particle\nhorizon is a monotically increasing function ofa,m o d e sw i t hac o m o v i n gs i z e\u0000>d eq larger\nthan the horizon at matter radiation equality entered the horizon when the universe was\nmatter dominated, whereas smaller modes\u0000<d eq entered the horizon when the universe\nwas still radiation dominated (see Fig. 1). It is only the latter set of small-scale modes\nwhich will have their potentials decay due to the Mezsaros e\u21b5ect. The comoving horizon at\nmatter-radiation equality is\ndeq \u2318 dph(aeq)=2 (\np\n2 \u0000 1)cH\u00001\n0 [\u2326m(1 +zeq)]\u00001/2 =1 1 0M p c ( 1 0 7 )\nwhere we used\n1+ zeq =3 5 0 0\n\u2713\u2326m,0\n0.30\n\u25c6\u2713 h\n0.70\n\u25c6\n, (108)\nwhich we previously calculated. Since we are working with the power spectrum, it is more\nconvenient to work with wavenumbers and we introduce\nkeq \u2318 2\u21e1\ndeq\n=0 .06 Mpc\u00001. (109)\n19\nTi\nNow let\u2019s consider an initial potential perturbation\u0000\u0000(k,t i)a ts o m et i m eti \u2327 teq,w h e r e\nteq is the time of matter radiation equality, which we would like to evolve forward to some\nlater time after decouplingt>t dec,b u tf o rw h i c ht h eu n i v e r s ei ss t i l lm a t t e rd o m i n a t e d .\nFor concreteness we will focus on a dark matter perturbation, which dominates the matter,\nand anyway as we saw in\u00a7 3.3, the baryons will start tracking the dark matter perturbation\nshortly after decoupling.\nConsider modes with k<k eq (\u0000>d eq), which will have entered the horizon when the\nuniverse was matter dominated. For both the super-horizon and sub-horizon evolution of\nthese modes the potential perturbation remains constant and thus\n\u0000\u0000(k,t )= \u0000\u0000(k,t i)( k<k eq). (110)\nNow consider smaller scale modes withk>k eq (\u0000<d eq). These modes entered the horizon\nwith potential perturbation at the value\u0000\u0000(k,t i)w h i c hw a sc o n s t a n ti nt i m e ,b u tu p o nh o r i -\nzon entry, because the universe is radiation dominated, they su\u21b5era\u00002 attenuation because\nof the Mezsaros e\u21b5ect until the epoch of matter radiation equality:\n\u0000\u0000(k,t )= \u0000\u0000(k,t i)\n\u2713aenter(k)\naeq\n\u25c62\n(k>k eq)., (111)\nwhere aenter(k) is the scale factor at which the modek entered the horizon, and the factor\n(aenter/aeq)2 re\ufb02ects the attenuation which occurs between the timeaenter(k)a n daeq.A t\nlater times a>a eq the universe is no longer radiation dominated, and so the potential will\nthen remain at a constant value until the timet (recall we assumed that att we are matter\ndominated).\nNotice that the timetenter at which the modek with wavelength\u0000 enters the horizon during\nradiation domination is \ufb01xed by the evolution of the particle horizon that we computed in\neqn. (99) above in\u00a7 4.1.1\naenter(k)\u0000 = aenter\n2\u21e1\nk =2 ctenter ) aenterk\u00001 / tenter. (112)\nBut we also have that during radiation dominationa / t1/2,s oc o m b i n i n gt h e s et w op r o p o r -\ntionalities we have\naenter(k)k\u00001 / tenter / a2\nenter(k) ) aenter / k\u00001, (113)\nwhich states that high-k (small-scale modes) entered the horizon earlier in time, which can\nbe clearly visualized from Fig. 1. This implies we can write the ratio\n\u2713aenter(k)\naeq\n\u25c62\n=\n\u2713keq\nk\n\u25c62\n. (114)\n20\n\u2f85\nThus we obtain\n\u0000\u0000(k,t )=\n(\n\u0000\u0000(k,t i) k<k eq\n\u0000\u0000(k,t i)(keq/k)2 k>k eq\n. (115)\nNow using\nh\u0000\u0000(k,t )\u0000\u0000(k0,t )i =( 2\u21e1)3\u0000D(k \u0000 k0)P\u0000(k,t ), (116)\nwe have\nP\u0000(k,t )=\n(\nP\u0000(k,t i) k<k eq\nP\u0000(k,t i)(keq/k)4 k>k eq\n.

(118)\nBut the perturbed Poisson\u2019s equation (eqn. (102)) gives\n\u0000k2\u0000\u0000(k,t )=4 \u21e1Ga2\u21e20\u0000(k,t ) ) \u0000(k,t ) / k2\u0000\u0000(k,t ), (119)\nwhich implies the density and potential power spectra are related via\nP\u0000 / k4P\u0000(k) ) P\u0000(k,t i)= Ak, (120)\nwhere A is a constant. So we \ufb01nally obtain\nP\u0000(k,t )=\n(\nAk k < k eq\nAk (keq/k)4 / k\u00003 k>k eq\n, (121)\nwhich explains the shape of the linear theory power spectrum for the overdensity\u0000,a n dw h y\nthe break in the shape occurs aroundkeq =0 .06 Mpc\u00001. In reality the attenuation during\nradiation domination is more like lna/a2, and furthermore the transition from radiation to\nmatter domination is smooth, which smooths out the peak in the power spectrum.\n4.3 Transfer Function\nWhat we have gone through in the last section is a simple analytical version of what the\nso-called transfer function is supposed to achieve. Namely, our goal is to write the linear\ntheory power spectrum for overdensity \ufb02uctuations at some timet as\nP(k,t )= P(k,t i)T2(k)D2(t), (122)\nwhere P(k,t i)i st h ep o w e rs p e c t r u ma tt h et i m ea tw h i c ht h ep e r t u r b a t i o n sw e r ec r e a t e d\n(i.e. after in\ufb02ation),D(t)i st h el i n e a rg r o w t hr a t et h a tw ed e \ufb01 n e de a r l i e r ,a n dT2(k)i st h e\ntransfer function.\nThe transfer function can be written in terms of a relationship between the mode amplitude\n21\no\nFigure 2: The variation of the density contrast in photons (red), baryons (green) and CDM\n(blue) with scale factor fork =0 .01 Mpc\u00001 (top) andk =1 .0M p c\u00001 (bottom). The density\ncontrasts are plotted in the conformal Newtonian gauge. Note the change in behavior for\nthe small-scale modes aroundaeq \u21e0 3 \u21e5 10\u00004, and decoupling atadec \u21e0 10\u00003. Figure from\nChallinor.\nat a creation scale factorai (time ti), and the mode amplitude at some scale factoram (time\ntm). Typically am is taken to be a time when the universe is still matter dominated, but\nwhere am is after recombination. Broadly speaking, the reason for choosingam to be an\nepoch after recombination is simply that prior to recombination the universe is opaque and\n22\nstructure is not observable. Thus one has\nT(k)= \u0000(k,t m)\n\u0000(k,t i) , (123)\nNote the transfer function is independent of the exact value of scale factoram,p r o v i d e d\nam is chosen to be when the universe is still matter dominated since at this point there are\nno other physical e\u21b5ects which could change the power spectrum shape in ak-dependent\nfashion until the universe starts to become \u21e4 dominated.\nThe transfer function models all the procceses that in\ufb02uence the growth of perturbations\nfrom formation until after recombination. We have discussed some but not all of these. The\nmain complication that we have ignored is related to the validity of the \ufb02uid approximation,\nwhich we discuss in the next section. There are many publicly avaialble codes to compute\nT(k). The major innovation was CMBFAST by Seljak and Zaldarriaga, as they \ufb01gured\nout a trick to perform the required Boltzmann equation integrations much faster than was\npreviously possible. There are now other codes that supercede CMBFAST in accuracy and\nease of use like CMBEASY, CAMB, CLASS, and PyCosmo.\nIn Fig. 2 we show transfer functions from one of these codes for photons, baryons, and\nCDM for modes of two di\u21b5erent sizes, one withk<k eq,w h e r e a st h eo t h e rh a sk>k eq.\nFor the small-scall modes (lower panel), which are Jeans-stable (k>k J or \u0000<\u0000 J )b e f o r e\nrecombination, we see acoustic oscillations in the tightly coupled photon-baryon \ufb02uid begin\nafter horizon entry a \u21e0 10\u00005, and then we observe the baryons catching up to the dark\nmatter after recombination when the Jeans mass plummets. You can also see a change in\nthe growth rate of the CDM perturbation (blue) aroundaeq \u21e0 3 \u21e5 10\u00004 illustrating the\nMeszaros e\u21b5ect. Note that density contrast mode amplitudes appear to not evolve when\nthey are outside the horizon, which appears to run contrary to our discussion in this section,\ni.e. see Table 1. This results from gauge freedom, i.e. our description of how super-horizon\nmodes evolve in\u00a7 4.1.3 was necessarily gauge dependent. Typically papers on the evolution\nof T(k) compare results in di\u21b5erent gauges. See for example Ma & Bertschinger (1995).\n5 Hot, Cold, or Warm Dark Matter?\n5.1 Free Streaming\nThe \ufb02uid approximation that we have used in these notes is valid only when the mean-free\npath of particles is much smaller than the spatial scale of the perturbation being considered.\nOtherwise, one has to use the Boltzmann equation to solve for the evolution of distribution\nfunctions. Perturbations in a nearly collisionless component (e.g. neutrinos, warm or hot\ndark matter) are subject to so-called Landau damping, also known as collisionless phase\nmixing or free streaming.C o l d d a r k m a t t e r c a n b e t r e a t e d a s a p r e s s u r e l e s s \ufb02 u i d i n\nthe limit that the particles are so massive that there is nofree-streaming due to their\nrandom thermal velocities. But for hot or warm dark matter, which could have inherited\nsigni\ufb01cant random thermal motions when the particles decoupled from the thermal bath,\nfree-streaming could be signi\ufb01cant. In such cases, one must use the Boltzmann equation to\n23\nsolve for the evolution of perturbations comparable to the free-streaming scale. A similar\nsituation arises for photons after decoupling, when they are no longer tightly coupled to the\nbaryons via Thompson scattering. As decoupling is approached, the photon mean free path\nbecomes larger, and photons can di\u21b5use out of overdense regions into underdense regions,\nthereby damping inhomogeneities in the photon-baryon plasma, a phenomenon known as\nSilk damping. To properly study the evolution of perturbations in the radiation (critical\ne.g. for the CMB) and their back reaction on perturbations in matter, one must resort to\nsolving the Boltzmann equation.\nThe transfer function codes that we described in the last section solve the Boltzmann equa-\ntion for various components (dark matter, photons, neutrinos) for which the \ufb02uid approxi-\nmations are invalid. We won\u2019t go into solving the Boltzmann equation for collisionless \ufb02uids,\nsince that is quite complicated. However, su\u0000ce it to say that something like the \ufb02uid\nequations comes out, where the \u201cpressure\u201d is instead contributed by the random motions of\nthe collisionless particles. The same type of linear perturbation theory analysis leads one to\nconclude that scales larger than a Jeans scale are unstable to gravitational collapse\n\u0000J \u2318 v\u21e4\n\u2713 \u21e1\nG\u21e2\n\u25c61/2\n, (124)\nwhere the velocityv\u21e4 replaces the sound speedcs that we had before where\nv\u00002\n\u21e4 =\nR\nv\u00002f(v)d3vR\nf(v)d3v \u2318h v\u00002i, (125)\nwhere f(v) is the collisionless particle (i.e. dark matter) velocity distribution function. For\nexample for a Maxwellian velocity distribution functionv\u21e4 = \u0000.\nJust like before, small-scale modesk>k J give rise to oscillatory solutions, but the crucial\ndi\u21b5erence is that these free-streaming motions rapidly dissipate \ufb02uctuations with\u0000<\u0000 FS.\nWhereas in a \ufb02uid with pressure, you set up oscillations, which could eventually turn into a\ngrowing mode for example if the Jeans scale rapidly drops (i.e. baryons after recombination),\nin this collisionless case, the \ufb02uctuations are actually erased because particles in an overdense\nregion can propagate to an underdense region rapidly equalizing any density \ufb02uctuations.\nHere we will simply estimate what the free-streaming length scale is, which you also did\non the homework. Once a collisonless species decouples from the thermal bath, which we\ntypically imagine to be an extremely early timetf when the particle froze-out, it simply\ntravels along a geodesic in an expanding Universe. We will assume that the particles motion\nis along a ray withd\u2713 = d\u0000 =0 ,s ot h a tt h ep r o p e rd i s t a n c et h a tt h i sp a r t i c l et r a v e l si n\nan expanding universe is justa(t)dx = v(t)dt,w h e r edx is a di\u21b5erential comoving distance.\nThus the comoving distance traveled by a free-streaming particle from some initial timetf\nto timet is the integral of these in\ufb01tesimal comoving distance intervalsdx,o r\n\u0000FS(t)=\nZ t\ntf\nv(t)\na(t0)dt0.

Since most of the observed structures in the\nuniverse \u2013 like galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc. \u2013 have a density constrast far in excess of\nunity, their formation can only be understood with a fully nonlinear theory. In the non-linear\nregime the evolution of the density \ufb01eld can no longer be described with a simple growth\nrate D(a). In general no analytic solutions exist. Because non-linearity implies mode-\ncoupling, we no longer have a Gaussian random \ufb01eld. We previously discussed that this\nmostly arises due to phase correlations, but the power spectrum will also deviate from linear\ntheory, and furthermore higher-order moments besides the two-point function are required to\ndescribe the statistical properties of the density \ufb01eld. An accurate treatment will of course\nrequire solving the equations of structure formation on a computer. But we can consider\nhighly oversimpli\ufb01ed analytical approximations which allow us to build intuition about this\nnon-linear evolution which will prove very useful in undertsanding and interpreting these\nnumerical results.\n1 Spherical Collapse\n1.1 Top-Hat Perturbation for an\u2326=1 Universe\nFigure 1: Illustration of a top-hat perturbation for the spherical collapse model.

Hence, the turn-around radius\ndepends only on the initial overdensity\u0000i (not on the actual mass enclosed by the shell).\nNote also that smaller perturbations have larger radii at turn-around, which implies that\nthey turnaround/collapse later.\nNow let us focus on the evolution of the actual overdensity.

This then provides a simple tool for determining when perturbations in the initial\nlinear \ufb02uctuations go non-linear and when they collapse. We will use this mapping when we\ndiscuss the Press-Schecter model for the abundance of dark matter halos, which allows one\nto compute halo abundances analytically using only the linear theory power spectrum.\nAccording to linear perturbation theory, in an Einstein-De Sitter universe perturbations grow\naccording to\n\u0000lin / D(a) / a / t2/3 ) \u0000lin = \u0000i\n\u2713 t\nti\n\u25c62/3\n. (21)\nIn order to compare our linear theory to the fully non-linear spherical collapse solution, we\nneed to determine how to normalize the linear theory solution, which amounts to matching\nthe initial conditions of our spherical collapse calculation. To do this, we Taylor expand the\nnon-linear solution for the overdensity in eqn. (20). Using\nsin \u2713 ' \u2713 \u0000 \u27133\n3! + \u27135\n5! \u0000 ... (22)\ncos \u2713 ' 1 \u0000 \u27132\n2! + \u27134\n4! \u0000 ..., (23)\nwhere we can ignore higher order terms, since the validity of linear theory requires\u0000 \u2327 1,\nwhich impliest \u2327 tta = \u21e1B and hence \u2713 \u2327 1. Thus\n(\u2713 \u0000 sin \u2713)2 '\n\u2713\u27133\n6 \u0000 \u27135\n120\n\u25c62\n' \u27136\n36\n\uf8ff\n1 \u0000 \u27132\n10\n\u0000\n(24)\n(1 \u0000 cos \u2713)3 '\n\u2713\u27132\n2 \u0000 \u27134\n24\n\u25c63\n' \u27136\n8\n\uf8ff\n1 \u0000 \u27132\n4\n\u0000\n. (25)\nCombining we \ufb01nd that in the\u2713 \u2327 1l i m i t\n1+ \u0000 =\n9\u27136\n36\nh\n1 \u0000 \u27132\n10\ni\n2\u27136\n8\n\u21e5\n1 \u0000 \u27132\n4\n\u21e4 '\n\uf8ff\n1 \u0000 \u27132\n10\n\u0000\n\u21e5\n\uf8ff\n1+ \u27132\n4\n\u0000\n' 1+ 3\u27132\n20 , (26)\nfrom which we conclude that\n\u0000 = 3\u27132\n20 . (27)\nIf we now use that\nt = B (\u2713 \u0000 sin \u2713) ' B\u27133\n6 , (28)\nwe see that in the\u2713 \u2327 1l i m i t\n\u2713 '\n\u27136t\nB\n\u25c61/3\n. (29)\nSubstituting the above expression for\u2713 into eqn. (27) for\u0000 we \ufb01nally obtain that that for\n6\nt \u2327 tta = \u21e1B,w h i c hi m p l i e s\u2713 \u2327 1a n d\u0000 \u2327 1,\n\u0000(t)= 3\n20\n\u27136t\nB\n\u25c62/3\n(\u0000 \u2327 1). (30)\nThus as expected, we see that in the small\u0000 regime, the spherical collapse solution recovers\nthe \u0000 / t2/3 / a behavior of linear theory. Noting that the linear theory solution follows\n\u0000lin = \u0000i\n\u2713 t\nti\n\u25c62/3\n, (31)\nto match the smallt (small \u2713 and \u0000)b e h a v i o ro ft h el i n e a ra n dn o n l i n e a rs o l u t i o n ,w ec a n\nevaluate both att = ti,w h i c hi m p l i e s\nB = 3ti\n4( 5\u0000i/3)3/2 , (32)\ncombining withA3 = GMB 2 and the expression forM in eqn. (14), we deduce that\nA = 3ri\n10\u0000i\n. (33)\nHence the non-linear solution is completely speci\ufb01ed in terms of quantities atti. Note that\nsince B only depends on ti and \u0000i, the time for turn around tta = \u21e1B and for collapse\ntcoll =2 \u21e1B,o c c u rs i m u l t a n e o u s l yf o ra l lm a s ss h e l l s .F o r m a l l y ,a ttcoll all the mass collapses\nto a singularity, but we will return to what actually happens at collapse for a more realistic\nnot-perfectly spherically symmetric situation shortly.\nNext we want to study the linear evolution on the same \u2018clock\u2019 as the non-linear evolution.\nThe equations above apply to\u2713 \u2327 1, but we need to uset(\u2713)i ne q n .( 7 )f o rl a r g e r\u2713.T h u s\nwe combine the two equations\n\u0000lin = \u0000i\n\u2713 t\nti\n\u25c62/3\n; t = B(\u2713 \u0000 sin \u2713)( 3 4 )\nto obtain\n\u0000lin = 3\n5\n\u27133\n4\n\u25c62/3\n(\u2713 \u0000 sin \u2713)2/3 . (35)\nWe have now expressed the linear theory solution in terms of the parameters of our fully\nnon-linear solution, allowing us to compare their predictions at di\u21b5erent times.\nThis mapping between linear and non-linear evolution is very powerful. Given the linear\ntheory evolution of a density \ufb02uctuation, we can then make statements about what the\nfully nonlinear density constrast should be assuming spherical collapse.

When a region is at turnaround with\u2713 = \u21e1 and t = tta and\nis detatching from the Hubble \ufb02ow,\u0000(\u2713 = \u21e1)=4 .6, so the characteristic overdensity of\nregions turning around is\u0000ta =4 .6! Furthermore, at this time, the linear theory contrast is\n7\n\u0000lin,ta(\u2713 = \u21e1)=1 .06. Consider a region that had a linear \ufb02uctuation of\n\u0000lin =0 .1a t z =2 0. (36)\nOur calculation thus implies it was at turnaround roughly at\na(tta)\na(z =2 0 )\u0000lin = \u0000lin,ta ) (1 +zta)=( 1+2 0 )\u0000lin\n\u0000lin,ta\n) (1 +zta) ' 2.0. (37)\nFurthermore, according to Table 1, we learn that att =2 \u21e1 when the spherical collapse model\nimplies collapse to a singularity, the linear theory density contrast is\u0000lin =1 .69. Thus if\nwe extrapolate linear theory to have an overdensity\u0000lin > 1.69, this corresponds to a region\nwhich hast>t coll in the spherical collapse model.

In the idealized\nspherically symmetric calculation we performed, this shell crossing \ufb01nally happens at\u2713 =2 \u21e1,\nwhich is the instant when all the mass collapses to a point. However, long before this happens\nthe approximation that the matter is distributed in perfectly spherically symmetric shells,\nand that the random (i.e. non-radial) velocities of the particles are small, will break down.\nThe collisionless matter we are considering will reach what is known asvirial equilibrium\nby a process known asviolent relaxation. Violent relaxation occurs as follows. During\nthe collapse there will be large \ufb02uctuations in the gravitational potential, on a time-scale\nor order of the free-fall collapse timetdyn =( G\u21e2)\u00001/2.S i n c e t h e p o t e n t i a l i s c h a n g i n g w i t h\ntime, individual particles do not follow energy conserving orbits. The change in energy of a\nparticle over this collapse timescale will depend in a complex way on its initial position and\nvelocity, but the net e\u21b5ect will be to redistribute energy among the particles and widen the\nrange of energies available to the particles. Thus a rapidly time variable potential provides\nam e c h a n i s mf o rp a r t i c l e st oe x c h a n g ee n e r g ya n dr e l a xt oa ne q u i l i b r i u md i s t r i b u t i o no na\ntimescale tdyn which is much shorter than the 2-body relaxation timescaletrelax ' Ntdyn/\n(10 lnN), which is normally the timescale which governs the evolution of a self-gravitating\ndistribution of N particles. Since the dark matter particle mass is likely extremely small,\nthe 2-body relaxation time would be many orders of magnitude larger than the Hubble time\ntrelax \u0000 tH. Violent relaxation operates much faster, and allows energy exchange ontdyn\nbecause of the rapidly varying gravitational potential.\nThe end result of violent relaxation will be that the system arives in a quasi-static equilibrium\nstate1 in which its random motions provide the equivalent of \u201cpressure support\u201d against\ngravity. This equilibrium is known asvirial equilibrium.T h e v i r i a l t h e o r e m s t a t e s t h a t\nany bound system of particles interacting via forces will obey\n\u00a8I =2 U +4 K, (39)\nwhere I is the moment of inertia of the system andU and K are the aggregate potential\nand kinetic energy of the system, respectively. Note that previously in eqn. 9 we derived\nexpressions for the speci\ufb01c energyE = U + K,w h e r eU and K are the potential and kinetic\nenergy per unit mass of the mass shell in question. These are distinct from the energies in\nthe virial theorem which represent the total potential and kinetic energy of the system.

(51)\nThis result allows us to determine the characteristic size, density, velocity, and temperature\n(of the baryonic component) for a collapsed object of a given mass. These collapsed objects\nare known asdark matter halos.\nAlthough spherical collapse captures some of the physics governing the formation of halos,\nstructure formation in a cold dark matter universe proceeds hierarchically. At early times,\nmost of the dark matter was in low-mass halos, and these halos then continously accreted\nand merged to form high-mass halos. Using high-resolutionN-body simulations to model\ngravitational instability of collisionless cold dark matter (CDM) particles with initial condi-\ntions drawn from the linear theory power spectrumP(k), Navarro et al. (1996) showed that\nthe spherically averaged density pro\ufb01les of the resulting halos are described by a roughly uni-\nversal function although there is considerable scatter among di\u21b5erent halos. This so-called\nNFW (short for Navarro-Frenk-White) pro\ufb01le has the form\n\u21e2(r)= \u21e2s\n(r/rs)( 1+r/rs)2 , (52)\nwhich is completely characterized by two parameters, massMvir and the concentration pa-\nrameter c = rvir/rs. Here rvir is related to Mvir via eqn. (51) and the spherical collapse\noverdensity \u0000vir.T h eq u a n t i t y\u21e2s is given by\n\u21e2s = \u21e2m(z)\u0000vir\nc3\n3f(c), (53)\nwhere\n\u21e2m(z)= \u21e2crit(z)\u2326m(z)=( 1+ z)3\u2326m0\n3H2\n0\n8\u21e1G, (54)\nand\nf(x)=l n ( 1+x) \u0000 x\n1+ x. (55)\nThe corresonding mass pro\ufb01le is\nM(<r )= Mvir\nf(cx)\nf(c) ; x = r\nrvir\n. (56)\nThe concentration parameterc = c(M,z ) is a function of the halo mass and time. Actually\nit is more appropriate to think of the concenration as a function of halo mass and formation\nredshift, since halos which collapse earlier are more dense.

Press & Schechter 1974 postulated that \u201cthe probability that\u0000M >\u0000 c(t)\nis the same as the mass fraction that at timet is contained in halos with mass greater than\n15\nM.\u201d The probability that\u0000M >\u0000 c(t) can be easily calculated. For a Gaussian random \ufb01eld,\none has that\nP [\u0000M >\u0000 c(t)] = 1p\n2\u21e1\u0000M\nZ 1\n\u0000c(t)\nexp\n\uf8ff\n\u0000 \u00002\nM\n2\u00002\nM\n\u0000\nd\u0000M = 1\n2 erfc\n\uf8ff \u0000c(t)p\n2\u0000M\n\u0000\n, (66)\nwhere erfc(x)=1 \u0000 erf(x)i st h ec o m p l i m e n t a r ye r r o rf u n c t i o n ,a n dw h e r ea g a i n\u0000c(t)= \u0000c/\nD(t), such that the collapse barrier evolves downard with time. According to the Press\nSchecter postulate above, we thus have\nF(>M ,t)= 1\n2 erfc\n\uf8ff \u0000c(t)p\n2\u0000M\n\u0000\n, (67)\nwhere F(>M , t) is the fraction of the total mass in the Universe in collapsed halos with\nmass larger thanM at time t.\nThere is however a serious problem with the Press-Schecter postulate.

This necessarily results from the Press-Schecter postulate of\nassociating positive linear theory density \ufb02uctucations with collapsed structures, and the fact\nthat we are dealing with a Gaussian random \ufb01eld which is symmetric about zero, implying\nthat the cumulative probability for a positive density \ufb02uctuation is\nP(\u0000> 0) = 1\n2. (68)\nIn linear theory, where \ufb02uctuations grow proportional to the linear growth rate\u0000(x,t ) /\nD(a), the positive \ufb02uctuations become more positive, and the negative \ufb02uctuations become\nmore negative, and so there is no way for the half of the volume of the universe corresponding\nto negative \ufb02uctuations to contain collapsed objects. However, underdense regions can be\nenclosed within larger overdense regions, giving them a \ufb01nite probability of being included\nin a larger collapsed object, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Press & Schechter argued, without a\nproper demonstration, that the material in initially underdense regions will eventually be\naccreted by the collapsed objects, doubling their masses without changing the shape of the\nmass function. They thus \u2018solved\u2019 this problem by simply introducing afudge factor of a\nfactor of 2, and instead adopted\nF(>M ,t)=2 P(\u0000M >\u0000 c(t)) = erfc\n\uf8ff \u0000c(t)p\n2\u0000M\n\u0000\n.

Density \ufb02uctuations\npresent at the time of decoupling source \ufb02uctuations in the CMB temperature both through\ntheir coupling to the radiation \ufb01eld and through their perturbation of the space time metric.\nThis information is encoded in the power spectrum of temperature anisotropies which have\nbeen recently measured to unprecedented precision by the Planck satellite. The Planck all\nsky CMB map is shown in Fig. 1, and the temperature power spectrum is shown in Fig. 2.\nOur goal in this lecture is to relate the features in this power spectrum to what we have\nlearned so far about structure formation.\nFigure 1: The anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) as observed by\nPlanck.\n1 Spherical Harmonics\nObservations of the CMB provide us with microwave temperature maps of the entire sky.\nWe need to be able to deal with a continuous spectrum of temperature \ufb02uctuations, and the\nnatural way of doing this is to take the Fourier transform of the intensity distribution. The\ntemperature \ufb02uctuations are distributed over the surface of a sphere, and so we need the two-\ndimensional spherical polar equivalent of the relation between the density distribution and\nits power spectrum, which we derived previously when we related the amplitude of Fourier\nmodes to the power spectrum in three Cartesian dimensions. For the surface of a sphere,\nthe appropriate complete sets of orthonormal functions are the spherical harmonic functions.\nThe \ufb01rst step is to make a spherical harmonic expansion of the temperature \ufb02uctuation over\n1\nFigure 2: Left: The power spectrum of CMB temperature anisotropies as measured by\nPlanck shown with power on a linear scale.Right: The power spectrum of CMB temperature\nanisotropies measured by various di\u21b5erent experiments shown with power on a log scale.\nthe entire sky\n\u0000T\nT (\u02c6n)= T(\u02c6n) \u0000 \u00afT\n\u00afT =\n1X\n`=0\nm=`X\nm=\u0000`\na`mY`m(\u02c6n), (1)\nwhere the Y`m are the orthonormal functions known as the spherical harmonics of degree`\nand orderm,a n dt h eu n i tv e c t o r\u02c6n denotes some direction on the sky (\u2713, \u0000).

(3)\nSimilar to the cosmological density perturbation\u0000(x), the observed CMB sky should be\nconsidered as one realization of a cosmological random \ufb01eld. For the density perturbation\nwe de\ufb01ned the power spectrum via the two-point correlation of the Fourier amplitudes, and\nused statistical isotropy and homogeneity to show that\nh\u0000(k)\u0000\u21e4(k0)i =( 2\u21e1)3\u0000D(k \u0000 k0)P(k). (4)\nWhat is the implication of statistical isotropy and homogeneity for the two-point correlation\n2\nof thea`m? It turns out we must have\nha`ma\u21e4\n`0m0 i = C`\u0000``0 \u0000mm0 , (5)\nwhere C` is the angular power spectrum.B y s t a t i s t i c a l i s o t r o p y t h e r e s h o u l d b e n o\npreferred directions on the sky such that each of the (2` +1 )c o e \u0000 c i e n t sa`m provides an\nindependent estimate of the amplitude of the temperature \ufb02uctuations associated with the\nmultipole `.T h ep o w e rs p e c t r u mC` can thus be written\nC` = 1\n2` +1\nX\nm\na`ma\u21e4\n`m = h|a`m|2i. (6)\nEquivalent to the power spectrum description, we can de\ufb01ne an auto-correlation function of\nthe temperature \ufb02uctuations as\nC(\u2713)=\n\u2327\u0000T\nT (\u02c6n)\u0000T\nT (\u02c6n0)\n\u0000\n, (7)\nwhere cos(\u2713)= \u02c6n \u00b7 \u02c6n0 is the angle between the two directions on the sky. The correlation\nfunction is related to the power spectrumC` by\nC(\u2713)= 1\n4\u21e1\nX\n`\n(2` +1 )C`P`(cos \u2713), (8)\nwhere P` is the Legendre polynomial of degree`,a n dw eh a v eu s e de q n .( 6 )a n dp r o p e r t i e s\nof the spherical harmonics to derive this expression.

(14)\nNote that the density \ufb02uctuations at decoupling are so small that they are de\ufb01nitely in the\nlinear regime. Since we believe that in\ufb02ation gave rise to Gaussian initial conditions, and\nsince we will see that the CMB temperature \ufb02uctuations are proportional to the density pe-\nrurbations, the CMB temperature \ufb02uctuation is a Gaussian random \ufb01eld, which implies that\nthe power spectrumC` (or equivalently the correlation functionC(\u2713)) provides acomplete\nstatistical description of the \ufb02uctuation distribution. This assumption of the Gaussianity of\nthe CMB has been tested to high precision.\n2 Physical Origin of Anisotropies\n2.1 Overview\nWe will now proceed to consider the physical origin of CMB anisotropies. First, one must\ndistinguish betweenprimary anisotropieswhich are generated at the last scattering sur-\nface, andsecondary anisotropies,w h i c ha r eg e n e r a t e db yp r o c e s s e sl i k ee l e c t r o ns c a t t e r i n g\nor gravitational redshifts that occur along the line-of-sight as the CMB photons propagate\ntowards earth.\nPrimary AnisotropiesThere are three basic primary e\u21b5ects which are important on large,\nintermediate, and small angular scales, respectively. They are:\nSuperhorizon Fuctuations The Sachs-Wolfe e\u21b5ect is a source of temperature\nanisotropy due to gravitational parturbations at the last scattering surface. It generates\n4\nFigure 3: Illustration of the physical mechanisms that cause CMB anisotropies. The shaded\narc on the right represents the last-scattering shell. Inhomogeneities on this shell a\u21b5ects the\nCMB through its potential/density \ufb02uctuations on both super and sub-horizon scales. Non-\nzero velocities at last scattering give rise to Doppler perturbations. Further perturbations\nare added along the line of sight by time-varying potentials (ISW & Rees\u2013Sciama e\u21b5ect)\nand by electron scattering from hot gas (Sunyaev\u2013Zeldovich e\u21b5ect). The density \ufb01eld at last\nscattering can be Fourier analyzed into modes of wavevectork. These spatial perturbation\nmodes have a contribution that is in general damped by averaging over the shell of last\nscattering. Short-wavelength modes are more heavily a\u21b5ected (i) because more of them \ufb01t\ninside the scattering shell, and (ii) because their wavevectors point more nearly radially for\nag i v e np r o j e c t e dw a v e l e n g t h .\ntemperature anisotropies on a scale larger than the particle horizon at the last scat-\ntering surface. Since causal processes cannot in\ufb02uence perturbation evolution on these\nscales, the temperature anisotropy results from the impact of the density/potential\n\ufb02uctuations on the metric itself, making this a purely gravitational e\u21b5ect.\nSubhorizon Fluctuations Below the horizon scale at the last scattering surface,\ncausal processes like pressure forces and the propagation of sound waves can operate.\nThe tightly coupled baryon-photon \ufb02uid results in acoustic oscillations driven by the\ndark matter density/potential \ufb02uctuations. Since the photons are tightly coupled to\nthe baryons, the densities of the two \ufb02uids scale proportionately\nnb / n\u0000; n\u0000 / T3; ) \u21e2b = nbmb / T3, (15)\n5\nwhere the n\u0000 / T3 results from the fact that the photons are a black body radiation\n\ufb01eld. Di\u21b5erentiating \u21e2b / T3, we \ufb01nd\n\u0000T\nT = 1\n3\n\u0000\u21e2b\n\u21e2b\n= \u0000b\n3 . (16)\nThus we see that \ufb02uctuations in the baryon density source CMB temperature anisotropies.\nThese are often referred to as isentropic or adiabatic perturbations, which is actually a\nstatement about the nature of the initial conditions on the modes before they entered\nthe horizon. These initial conditions are set by the physics of in\ufb02ation, and isen-\ntropic/adiabatic initial conditions mean that the ratio of matter to radiation, which is\nequivalent to the entropy per baryon, is conserved.\nDoppler Flucutations The photon-baryon \ufb02uid has a non-zero velocity at last-\nscattering. Scattering of CMB photons o\u21b5 of electrons with non-zero velocities leads\nto Doppler shifts in photon frequency and hence in the temperature of the CMB.\nSecondary AnisotropiesThere are three primary sources of secondary anisotropies. We\nwill not have time to discuss these and only mention them very brie\ufb02y:\nIntegrated Sachs Wolfe & Rees Sciama E\u21b5ectsresult from CMB photons travers-\ning time varying potentials along the line-of-sight. This sources additional temperature\nanisotropy.\nSunyaev-Zeldovich E\u21b5ect When CMB photons encounter hot plasma along the\nline-of-sight they will be Compton up scattered to higher frequencies. The largest SZ\nsignals are associated with foreground clusters of galaxies, which are large collapsed\nnon-linear structures at low-redshift which have plasma temperatures ofT ' 107 K.\nThomson Scattering from ReionizationWhen the universe is reionized atz ' 7\u00008\nthe free electrons can Thompson scatter CMB photons. This has as a small e\u21b5ect on\nthe temperature anisotropy pattern, but results in a large e\u21b5ect on the polarization\nof the CMB, since Thompson scattering of a quadropole anisotropy produces linear\npolarization.\nOur strategy for understanding CMB anisotropies will be to start with the largest angular\nscales and progress to smaller scales. We will \ufb01rst learn about the Sachs-Wolfe e\u21b5ect, which is\nthe dominant source of large angular scale anisotropy. Moving to smaller sub-horizon angular\nscales brings in causal processes which complicates analysis. We will attempt to understand\nsome of the characteristic behavior like the origin of the acoustic peaks at intermediate\nangular scales and the damping of \ufb02uctuations on small-angular scales. Finally, we will\nconclude by describing how a full numerical calculation of the CMB power spectrum is\nperformed by solving the Boltzmann equation, which will help us better understand the\ncomplexity of the physics.\n6\n2.2 Large Angular Scales\n2.2.1 The Particle Horizon\nOn the homework you computed the particle horizon at decoupling, and we similarly calcu-\nlated this quantity when discussing in\ufb02ation\nrph(tdec)=\nZ tdec\n0\ncdt\na(t) =2 7 4c M p c. (17)\nThis comoving distance corresponds to a proper distance ofdph = adecdph(tdec)=0 .251 Mpc\u21e0\nctdec at tdec.W e p r e v i o u s l y f o u n d t h a tdA(tdec)=1 2 .8 Mpc, and hence a patch of the last\nscattering surface with size equal to the particle horizon will subtend an angle\n\u2713ph = rph(tdec)\ndA(tdec)(1 +zdec) =1 .1\u0000 ) `ph = \u21e1\n\u2713ph\n=1 6 3. (18)\nThus any \ufb02uctuation with multipole` . 160 represents a super-horizon temperature \ufb02uctu-\nation.\nWhen we discussed structure formation, we argued that evolution of super-horizon modes\ndi\u21b5ers signi\ufb01cantly from sub-horizon modes. Whereas we could analyze the behavior of sub-\nhorizon \ufb02uctuations using Newtonian mechanics, as expressed by the Euler and continuity\nequations, we argued that super-horizon \ufb02uctuations evolve di\u21b5erently. A super-horizon\nmode is not in causal contact with itself, and so things like sound waves cannot propagate\nacross it. In GR perturbation theory, the gravitational potential of these \ufb02uctuations is the\nperturbation to the metric, and thus we have the result that for these modes the potential\nperturbation is constant in time.\nWhen we discussed the shape of the matter power spectrumP(k), we argued that what\nwere super-horizon modes are constantly entering the horizon as the Universe expands be-\ncause the horizon grows with time faster than the proper length scale (or equivalently, a\ncomoving length scale stays \ufb01xed with time but the comoving particle horizon grows with\nthe expansion). Analogously, because the universe expanded by a factor of\u21e0 1000 sincetdec,\nwe are now able to see many horizon size\u21e0 1\u0000 patches of the CMB that were not in causal\ncontact with each other. The \ufb02uctuations on these scales retain their primordial character\nsince they will not have been modi\ufb01ed by any causal processes inside the horizon beforetdec.\nThese frozen in potential \ufb02uctuations thus contain unique information about the form of the\nunprocessed initial power spectrum of \ufb02uctuations put in place by in\ufb02ation. These can be\ndirectly measured via the Sachs-Wolfe e\u21b5ect, as we discuss next.\n2.2.2 The Sachs-Wolfe E\u21b5ect\nOn large scales the dominant contribution to \u0000T/T is the Sachs\u2013Wolfe e\u21b5ect. This is\nar e l a t i v i s t i ce \u21b5 e c td u et ot h ef a c tt h a tp h o t o n st r a v e l l i n gt oa no b s e r v e rf r o mt h el a s t\nscattering surface encounter metric perturbations which cause them to change frequency.\nThe Sachs-Wolfe e\u21b5ect is actually a manifestation of two releativistic e\u21b5ects.\n7\nGravitational Redshift Imagine an overdensity at recombination which gives rise to a\ngravitational potential \ufb02ucutation\u0000\u0000. First there will be a gravitational redshift resulting\nfrom the density \ufb02uctuations, and at decoupling the temperature re\ufb02ects a snapshot of the\npotential well the photons were in at the time of last scattering\nEinit + \u0000\u0000\n\u2713Einit\nc2\n\u25c6\n| {z }\nphoton \u201cmass\u201d\n= E\ufb01nal\n) \u0000E\nE = \u0000\u0000\nc2 . (19)\nBut the photons obey the Bose-Einstein distribution function\nfBE = 1\neE/(kBT ) \u0000 1, (20)\nwhich is a conserved quantity. So this implies\n\u0000T\nT = \u0000\u0000\nc2 . (21)\nThus in an overdense region (\u0000\u0000 < 0) there will be a net decrease of temperature\u0000T < 0\ndue to the gravitational redshift of the photons.\nTime DilationIn the limit of weak \ufb01elds, one can write the perturbed FRW metric as\nds2 = \u0000(1 + 2\u0000/c2)dt2 + a(t)(1 \u0000 2\u0000/c2)\n\u21e5\ndx2 + dy2 + dz2\u21e4\n, (22)\nwhere the coordinate timet is the cosmic time of the background unperturbed model.

(28)\nThe physical interpretation is that because clocks run slower in an ovedense region (\u0000\u0000 < 0),\nthe universe will be younger and thus e\u21b5ectively hotter\u0000T > 0. Note that this has the\nopposite sign of the gravitational redshift term above.\nHence we learn that that the net temperature anisotropy generated from theSachs-Wolfe\ne\u21b5ect is \u2713\u0000T\nT\n\u25c6\nSW\n=\n\u2713\u0000T\nT\n\u25c6\ntime\n+\n\u2713\u0000T\nT\n\u25c6\ngrav\n= \u00002\n3\n\u0000\u0000\nc2 + \u0000\u0000\nc2 = 1\n3\n\u0000\u0000\nc2 (29)\n2.2.3 Measuring the Primordial Power Spectrum\nWe can now understand why the dimensionless power spectrum \u00002\nT / `2C` is essentially \ufb02at\nat low` . 100.

From the Planck website.\n2.3 Intermediate Angular Scales: The Acoustic Peaks\n2.3.1 The Sound Horizon\nBefore we delve into the physics of the acoustic oscillations, we will calculate the characterstic\nlength scale below which they operate, which is the sound horizon at the last scattering\nsurface. This is the maximum distance which sound waves could travel and undergo coherent\noscillations. By analogy with the particle horizon it is de\ufb01ned as the comoving distance\nrs(tdec)=\nZ tdec\n0\ncsdt\na(t), (34)\n1The so-called integrated Sachs-Wolfe e\u21b5ect makes this slightly more complicated, but we ignore that\norder \u21e0 10% e\u21b5ect here.\n10\nwhich corresponds to the proper distance rs,prop = adecrs(tdec) \u21e0 cstdec,w h e r ecs is the\nsound speed of the photon-baryon \ufb02uid. The sound horizon therefore sets an upper limit\nto the wavelengths which acoustic waves could have at the epoch of recombination. In the\nhomework you showed that the sound speed of the photon-baryon \ufb02uid can be written\ncs =\n\u2713@P\n@\u21e2\n\u25c61/2\nS\n= cp\n3\n\uf8ff3\u21e2b\n4\u21e2\u0000\n+1\n\u0000\u00001/2\n= cp\n3( 1+R)\n, (35)\nwhere\nR(zdec)= 3\u21e2b\n4\u21e2\u0000\n= 3\u2326b0\u21e2critc4\n16\u0000T 4\n0 (1 +zdec) =3 .045 \u21e5 104 \u2326b0h2\n(1 +zdec) =0 .685, (36)\nfor our reference parameters atzdec =1 0 9 0 ,w h e r e\u0000 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

(38)\nThe size of the sound horizon at decoupling sets the characteristic angular scale of the\nacoustic peaks seen in the CMB power spectrum in Fig. 2.\nInspection of the CMB power spectra in Fig. 2 indicates that the \ufb01rst peak in the power\noccurs at around this multipole, and that the other peaks in the spectrum occur at what\nappear to be harmonics of this multipole. The reason for this is that on small scales below\nthe sound horizon, the amplitude of the Fourier modes exhibit temporal oscillations. Modes\nthat are caught at maxima or minima of their oscillation attdec correspond to peaks in the\npower. Because sound takes half as long to travel half as far, modes corresponding to peaks\nfollow a harmonic relationship. Let\u2019s try to understand the physics of this in more detail.\n2.3.2 Acoustic Oscillations\nOur analysis in this section will be necessarily approximate and aims to heuristically illustrate\nthe basic physics behind the acoustic oscillations. The full treatment requires solving the\nBoltzmann equation in GR, which is beyond the scope of this course, although we sketch\nout the general approach in the next section. Unlike our analysis of the SW e\u21b5ect, on sub-\nhorizon scales causal processes related to the motion of the \ufb02uid in the DM potential wells,\nthe compensating pressure gradients, and the resulting sound waves all have time to operate.\nPreviously we discussed the coupled perurbations of dark matter and the tightly coupled\nphoton-baryon \ufb02uid before recombination in the context of linear perturbation theory. We\n11\nwrote down the following equations:\n\u00a8\u0000c +2 H \u02d9\u0000c =4 \u21e1G(\u21e2c\u0000c + \u21e2b\u0000b) \u21e1 4\u21e1G\u21e2c\u0000c (39)\n\u00a8\u0000b +2 H \u02d9\u0000b = \u0000 c2\nsk2\na2 \u0000b +4 \u21e1G(\u21e2c\u0000c + \u21e2b\u0000b) \u21e1\u0000 c2\nsk2\na2 +4 \u21e1G\u21e2c\u0000c, (40)\nwhere in the last equality we have assumed that the dark matter dominates the matter\ncontent. Since the dark matter dominates the gravity and the expansion rate, the universe\nis Einstein-de Sitter and matter dominated, and eqn. (39) for the dark matter yields the\ngrowing solution\u0000 / a(t)w h i c hw es t u d i e db e f o r e . T h u st h e4\u21e1G\u21e2c\u0000c in the baryon evolution\nequation can be thought of as an external driving term. Given the pressure term in the\nevolution equation for the baryons, the Jeans scale\u0000J ' csH\u00001 \u21e0 cH\u00001 is comparable to\nthe sound horizon \u2013 we expect to see acoustic oscillations.\nSince here we are focusing on the acoustic oscillations, the timescale of interest is the sound\ncrossing time\nts = \u0000\ncs\n\u21e0 a\nkcs\n, (41)\nand in our approximate treatment we can thus ignore the Hubble drag term in eqn. (40)\nrelative to the other terms involving\u0000b,i . e .\n2H \u02d9\u0000b \u21e0\n\u02d9\u0000b\nt \u2327 \u00a8\u0000b \u21e0 \u0000b\nt2\ns\n;2 H \u02d9\u0000b \u2327 k2c2\ns\na2 \u0000b \u21e0 \u0000b\nt2\ns\n. (42)\nWe can also use the perturbed Poisson equation for the dark matter\nr2\u0000\u0000c =4 \u21e1Ga2\u21e2c\u0000c )\u0000 k2\u0000\u0000c(k,t )=4 \u21e1Ga2\u21e2c\u0000c(k,t ), (43)\nto replace 4\u21e1G\u21e2c\u0000c with \u0000k2\u0000\u0000c(k,t )/a2. Thus we can \ufb01nally recast the evolution equation\nfor the baryons (eqn. (40)) as\n\u00a8\u0000b + k2c2\ns\na2 \u0000b = \u0000k2\na2 \u0000\u0000c. (44)\nNow note that at early times around recombination, the universe will be matter dominated\nand Einstein-de Sitter with \u2326tot =1 ,a n di nt h i sr e g i m ew es h o w e dp r e v i o u s l yt h a tl i n e a r\ntheory predicts the potential perturbation does not evolve with time, so\u0000\u0000c(k,t )= \u0000\u0000c(k).\nThe equation above is thus the equation of motion for a forced harmonic oscillator, with a\nconstant forcing term. It admits solutions of the form\n\u0000b(k,\u2318 )=\n\uf8ff\n\u0000b(k, 0) +\u0000\u0000c\nc2\ns\n\u0000\ncos(kcs\u2318)+ 1\nkcs\nd\u0000b\nd\u2318 (k, 0) sin(kcs\u2318) \u0000 \u0000\u0000c\nc2\ns\n, (45)\nwhere we have introduced the conformal time as the new time variable,\n\u2318 =\nZ t\n0\ndt\na(t); rs = cs\u2318, (46)\n12\nand have noted that the sound horizon is equal to the product of the sound speed and the\nconformal time. This equation states that\u0000b(k,t )o s c i l l a t e sa r o u n daz e r o - p o i n t ,\u0000\u0000\u0000c/c2\ns,\nwith a frequency equal to! = kcs,a n dw i t ha m p l i t u d ea n dp h a s es e tb yt h ei n i t i a lc o n d i t i o n s\n\u0000b(k,t =0 )a n dd\u0000b/d\u2318(k,t =0 ) .\nThe motion of the photon-baryon \ufb02uid will also source anisotropies due electron scattering.\nUsing the perturbed continuity equation ink-space\n\u02d9\u0000b + 1\nar\u00b7 \u0000vb =0 ) ik \u00b7 vb = \u0000a \u02d9\u0000b, (47)\nwe can also obtain the time evolution of the corresponding baryon velocity perturbations\nvb(k,t )= ik\nk2\nd\u0000b\nd\u2318 = \u0000icsk\nk\n\uf8ff\n\u0000b(k, 0) +\u0000\u0000c\nc2\ns\n\u0000\nsin(kcs\u2318)+ ik\nk2\nd\u0000b\nd\u2318 (k, 0) cos(kcs\u2318). (48)\nNote that there is a phase di\u21b5erence of\u21e1/2 between the velocity and density perturbations,\nas is characteristic of a longitudinal acoustic wave.\nHow can we relate these density and velocity perturbations to the CMB temperature anisotropy\n\u0000T/T ? First note that, as discussed at the beginning of\u00a7 2.1, the CMB anistropy is sourced\nby multiple terms, namely the gravitational or SW e\u21b5ect, ansitropy due to baryon \ufb02uctua-\ntions, and Doppler shifts sourced by velocity \ufb02uctuations\n\u0000T\nT (k,t )=\n\u2713\u0000T\nT\n\u25c6\ngrav\n+\n\u2713\u0000T\nT\n\u25c6\n\u21e2\n+\n\u2713\u0000T\nT\n\u25c6\nv\n= \u0000\u0000(k,t )\nc2 + \u0000b(k,t )\n3 + 1p\n3\n|vb|\nc , (49)\nwhere we have included the Sachs-Wolfe gravitational redshift term (\u0000T/T )grav = \u0000\u0000(k,t )/\nc2,a n du s e dt h er e l a t i o n s h i p( \u0000T/T )\u21e2 = \u0000b/3t h a tw ed e r i v e di ne q n .( 1 6 ) .F o rt h eD o p p l e r\nvelocity perturbation, we have used the fact that all three spatial directions should have the\nsame rms value of the velocity, and so the Doppler line-of-sight contribution resulting from\nthe motion of the \ufb02uid is just \u2713\u0000T\nT\n\u25c6\nv\n= vk\nc = |vb|p\n3 . (50)\nLet\u2019s focus on the \ufb01rst two terms \ufb01rst, namely the sum of the gravitational and density\ncontributions to the anisotropy. These two terms \u2013 typically called the \u201ce\u21b5ective temperature\n\ufb02uctuation\u201d \u2013 re\ufb02ect the observed temperature \ufb02uctuation due to gravitational redshifting\nof photons as they climb out of potential wells and compression/rarefaction of the gas\n\u2713\u0000T\nT\n\u25c6\ne\u21b5\n\u2318\n\u2713\u0000T\nT\n\u25c6\ngrav\n+\n\u2713\u0000T\nT\n\u25c6\n\u21e2\n= \u0000\u0000(k,t )\nc2 + \u0000b(k,t )\n3 . (51)\nPlugging in our solution for\u0000b from eqn. (45) above we obtain\n\u2713\u0000T\nT\n\u25c6\ne\u21b5\n= \u0000\u0000c\nc2 +\n\uf8ff\u0000b(k, 0)\n3 + \u0000\u0000c\n3c2\ns\n\u0000\ncos(kcs\u2318)+ 1\n3kcs\nd\u0000b\nd\u2318 (k, 0) sin(kcs\u2318) \u0000 \u0000\u0000c\n3c2\ns\n. (52)\n13\nNow usingcs = c/\np\n3( 1+R), we can write this solution as\n\u2713\u0000T\nT\n\u25c6\ne\u21b5\n=[ \u21e50(k, 0) + (1 +R) ] cos(kcs\u2318)+ 1\nkcs\nd\u21e50\nd\u2318 (k, 0) sin(kcs\u2318) \u0000R  , (53)\nwhere we have introduced the new variables \u21e50 = \u0000b/3a n d = \u0000\u0000c.L i k e w i s e , u s i n g\neqn. (50) the Doppler component of the perturbation can be written\n\u2713\u0000T\nT\n\u25c6\nv\n=\np\n3cs\nc\n\uf8ff\n\u21e50(k, 0) + (1 +R) \nc2\n\u0000\nsin(kcs\u2318) \u0000\np\n3\nk\nd\u21e50\nd\u2318 (k, 0) cos(kcs\u2318). (54)\nFor the moment, let us focus on the e\u21b5ective temperature \ufb02uctuation, i.e. the gravity plus\ndensity term, which turns out to dominate the power. It is clear from the form of eqn. (53),\nthat the form of the acoustic oscillations is governed by the two initial conditions\n\u21e50(k, 0) and d\u21e50\nd\u2318 (k, 0), (55)\nat time \u2318 =0 .

When we observe the CMB at decoupling, we are basically taking a\nsnapshot of the radiation \ufb01eld at\u2318 = \u2318dec,w h i c ha m o u n t st oe v a l u a t i n g( \u0000T/T )e\u21b5(\u2318 = \u2318dec).\nIf we superpose a large collection of modes with di\u21b5erent wavelengths (wavenumbersk)a n d\narbitrary phase (i.e. set by the values of the initial conditions \u21e50(k, 0) and d\u21e50/d\u2318(k, 0)),\nthis should not result in a preferred scale that produces peaks in the power spectrum. Why\ndo we observe peaks in the CMB power spectrum?\nTo answer this question we \ufb01rst need to to be more clear about what we mean by \u201cinitial\nconditions\u201d, that is what time is\u2318 = 0? The initial conditions for these acoustic oscillations\nshould be set at the time at which causal physics begins to operate, in other words what\nwe mean by\u2318 = 0 is actually the time at which a given mode entered the horizon. It turns\nout that in\ufb02ation can only excite so-calledisentropic perturbationsfor which the ratio of\nthe matter and radiation is a constant at horizon entry. These correspond to pure curvature\n\ufb02uctuations or perturbations to the metric on super-horizon scales. They are called isentropic\nbecause a constant ratio of radiation to matter implies that the entropy per baryons/nB is\nconstant. The alternative are so-calledisocurvature perturbationsfor which the entropy\nper baryon can \ufb02uctuate from point to point. This is achieved by for example allowing the\nbaryon density to \ufb02uctuate on a \ufb01xed radiation backround. We won\u2019t be able to go into\nmore detail about how these \ufb02uctuations are classi\ufb01ed, but the upshot is that isentropic\n\ufb02uctuations only excite the cosine term in eqn. (53) at horizon entry, in other words we have\n\u21e50(k, 0) = const; d\u21e50\nd\u2318 (k, 0) = 0, (56)\nwhich corresponds to an initial metric perturbation, whereas isocurvature \ufb02uctuations excite\nthe sine mode at horizon entry, which corresponds to zero initial metric perturbation. Now\n14\nrecall the de\ufb01nition of the conformal time\u2318\n\u2318 =\nZ t\n0\ndt0\na(t0) ) rph(t)= c\u2318. (57)\nThus for a given modek,h o r i z o nc r o s s i n go c c u r sa t\nrph[\u2318h(k)] =c\u2318h(k)= 2\u21e1\nk ) \u2318h(k)= 2\u21e1\nck . (58)\nThe important thing to note is that the phase of an acoustic wave at horizon crossing is\nphase =kcs\u2318h(k) \u21e0 1, (59)\nis a constant of order unity which is independent ofk.T h u s ,t h ez e r op o i n to ft h ep h a s eo f\nevery mode can be consistently set at horizon crossing, such that e\u21b5ectively all the modes\nare setup with some initial amplitude of the cosine term in eqn. (53).\nThat fact that in\ufb02ation \u201clines up the phases\u201d allows us to now understand what gives rise\nto the peaks in the CMB power spectrum.

Since the power spectrum\nis e\u21b5ectively the square of the temperature perturbation\u0000T/T ,b o t hm a x i m a( h o ts p o t s )a n d\nminima (cold spots) give rise to peaks in the power spectrum, as illustrated by Fig. 6\nNow that we have understood the basic physical picture for the origin of the acoustic peaks,\nwe can gain further insight into the shape of the CMB power spectrum with just a little\nmore work. We argued that only the cosine term is excited, thus\n\u2713\u0000T\nT\n\u25c6\ne\u21b5\n=\n\uf8ff\n\u21e50(k, 0) + (1 +R) \nc2\n\u0000\ncos(kcs\u2318) \u0000R  \nc2 . (62)\nTo determine the initial condition \u21e50(k, 0) we consider the behavior of the equation above\n15\nas \u2318 ! 0. This corresponds to horizon entry, at which time the causal physics that gives\nrise to the acoustic oscillations and the Doppler shifts that result from electron scattering,\nwill not have time to operate. That is, at the earliest times our solution needs to be equal\nto the Sachs-Wolfe anistropy that we derived previously, which implies\n\u21e50(k, 0) + \nc2 = 1\n3\n \nc2 ) \u21e50(k, 0) =\u00002\n3\n \nc2 . (63)\nRecall that  is a constant in time (recall density perutrbations grow asa,b u tp o t e n t i a l s\nare constant) if the universe is matter dominated. So we can \ufb01nally write the solution for\nthe e\u21b5ective temperature anisotropy\n\u2713\u0000T\nT\n\u25c6\ne\u21b5\n(\u2318dec)=  \n3c2 (1 + 3R)c o s (krs) \u0000R  \nc2 . (64)\nFor the Doppler term we have\n\u2713\u0000T\nT\n\u25c6\nv\n(\u2318dec)=  \n3c2\n(1 + 3R)\n(1 +R)1/2 sin(krs), (65)\nwhere, similar to our analysis for (\u0000T/T )e\u21b5,w eu s e dt h ei n i t i a lc o n d i t i o n si ne q n s .( 5 6 )\nand (63). Therefore, the amplitude of the temperature \ufb02uctuation given by a Fourier mode\nwith wavenumberk is determined by  ,R,a n dt h ep h a s ekrs of the acoustic wave at the\nlast-scattering surface.\nUsing these solutions we can explain multiple observed properties of the CMB power spec-\ntrum:\nAssyemtric peak heightsEvaluating (\u0000T/T )e\u21b5 at the peaks which havek = n\u21e1/rs we\nsee that\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u2713\u0000T\nT\n\u25c6\ne\u21b5\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 =\n8\n><\n>:\n| |\n3c2 (1 + 6R)( n =o d d )\n| |\n3c2 (n =e v e n ),\n(66)\nand the odd harmonics will have higher amplitude than the even harmonics. Inspection of\nFig. 8 illustrates that this is indeed the case for the magenta curve (labeled SW) which shows\nthe (\u0000T/T )e\u21b5 contribution. This enhancement of the odd peaks relative to the even peaks\noccurs because the odd peaks correspond to compressions of the sound waves, and the inerita\nof the baryons (as quanti\ufb01ed by theR factor) enhances these relative to the rarefactions.\nThe Doppler anisotropy should be \u21e1/2o u to fp h a s ew i t ht h ee \u21b5 e c t i v et e m p e r a t u r e\nanistropy, because of the cos(krs)v ss i n (krs), which we see is the case in Fig. 8 (blue\ncurve). Furthemore, the amplitude at the peaks of the Doppler term will not be as large as\nthe e\u21b5ective temperature term. As such, in the CMB power spectrumC` the Doppler term\npeaks \ufb01ll the valleys between the peaks of e\u21b5ective temperature rather than appearing as\npeaks themselves.\nCosmological parameter dependencies The CMB has many strong dependencies on\n16\np2pp31stacoustic peakfluid compressionin potential wells\n2ndacoustic peakfluid compressionin potential hills\n3rdacoustic peakfluid compressionin potential wellswellhilltimedT/T\nbaryon photon fluid propagated this far since Big Bang  Figure 5: Illustration of why certain modes will result in acoustic peaks in the CMB.

Because the sound horizonrs can\nbe computed from \ufb01rst principles, it amounts to a standard ruler. Given that we can also\ncalculate the redshift of decoupling from \ufb01rst principles, we can use this standard ruler\nrs and the known redshift of decouplingzdec to determine the angular diameter distance\nto the surface of last scatteringDA(zdec). Because the angular diameter distance varies\nconsiderably for an open, \ufb02at, or closed universek =0 , 1, \u00001, the location of the \ufb01rst peak\nalone determines the the geometry of the metric.

This plot of the visibility function clearly indicates that CMB\nphotons were not last scattered at a single redshift, but rather over a range of redshifts. The\nmaximum of the visibility function occurs at a redshift ofz =1 0 9 0 ,w h i c hw ei d e n t i f ya s\n18\nthe redshift of decoupling. It has half maxima lying at redshifts ofz =1 1 7 8a n dz =9 8 3 ,\ncorresponding to a redshift interval of \u0000z = 195. For the benchmark cosmology, the redshift\nof the maximum of the visibility function correspondeds to an age of the universe oft =\n370, 000 years after the Big Bang, and most of the photons were last scattered between the\nepochs t =3 2 0, 000 andt =4 4 0, 000 years.\nAlthough the last scattering surface is not strictly speaking a surface, but rather a volume\nwith a \ufb01nite thickeness, it is nevertheless su\u0000ciently thin that we can imagine it as acting\nlike a kind of photon barrier, similar to the photosphere of the Sun. No information carried\nby photons originating fromz & 1100 can reach the Earth, as the photons involved will be\nscattered many times.\nLet us work out the increment of comoving radial distance coordinate corresponding to\nthe thickness of the last scattering layer. At large redshifts, we can neglect the vaccum\nenergy relative to the matter density, and so an in\ufb01testimal interval of line-of-sight comoving\ndistance is\ndr = cdt\na = cdz\nH(z) ' cH\u00001\n0\ndz\nz3/2\u23261/2\nm0\n.

(71)\nAlthough this is a distance along the line-of-sight, it is useful to calculate the angle on the\nsky it would project to, or equivalently the multipole` ' 2\u21e1/\u2713\n\u2713 =9 .5a r c m i n ;` ' 2\u21e1\n\u2713 =2 2 7 0. (72)\nOn comoving scales less than \u0000r ' 40 Mpc, corresponding to angles smaller than about\n\u2713 . 10 arcmin or multipoles greater than` & 1000, because of the \ufb01nite thickness of the\nlast-scattering layer, we expect the observed CMB to result from a number of independent\n\ufb02uctuations along the line-of-sight through the last scattering layer. Consequently, the ran-\ndom superposition of these perturbations leads to a statistical reduction in the amplitude\nof the observed intensity \ufb02uctuations by a factor of roughlyN\u00001/2,w h e r eN is the number\nof \ufb02uctuations of a given size probed along the line of sight, i.e.N ' \u0000r/\u0000.T h e p o w e r\nspectrum of the CMB will thus be suppressed on this scale. This suppression is essentially\njust geometric, i.e. it results from the fact that the CMB cannot be treated as a thin surface\nfor \ufb02uctuations comparable to the thickenss of the surface. This suppression of \ufb02uctuations\nfor ` & 1000 can be seen in the CMB power spectrum in Fig.??.T h e r e i s i n f a c t a s e c o n d\nsource of suppression known asSilk Damping,d u et ot h ef a c tt h a tp h o t o n sc a nd i \u21b5 u s eo u t\nof overdensities via Thompson scattering. Analogous to free-streaming, small-scale \ufb02uctua-\ntions will be suppressed.\n19\n3 The Boltzmann Equation\nPredicting the power spectrum of CMB anisotropies is a challenging task. Because it involves\n\ufb02uctuations in the relativistic photon-baryon \ufb02uid on scales comparble to or in excess of the\nhorizon, GR is required. The full apparatus of perturbing the Einstein gravitational \ufb01eld\nequations yields equations that are analogous to the equations we derived when studying\nlinear structure formation in the Newtonian approximation. As we discussed previously when\ndiscussing transfer functions, additional complications arises because components like the\nphotons (at decoupling when the mean free-path becomes large), neutrinos, or dark matter\n(if there is signi\ufb01cant free-streaming) do not behave like a \ufb02uid and so the full Boltzmann\nequation must be solved. By considering the Boltzmann equation in GR, linearizing it, and\nthen taking moments to derive equations like the \ufb02uid equations, one obtains a set of coupled\ndi\u21b5erential equations for the Fourier mode amplitudes of the various quantities of interest:\n\u02d9\u21e5+ ik\u00b5\u21e5= \u0000 \u02d9\u0000 \u0000 ik\u00b5 \u0000 \u02d9\u2327 [\u00b5vb \u0000 \u21e5]\n\u02d9vb + \u02d9a\navb = \u0000 ik + \u02d9\u2327\nR [vb +3 i\u21e51] . (73)\nHere \u21e5 \u2318 \u0000T/T is the Fourier transform of the perturbation to the photon distribution\nfunction, \u21e5(x, \u02c6p,t ), de\ufb01ned by\nf(x,p ,\u02c6p,t )=\n\uf8ff\nexp\n\u21e2 p\nT(t)[1 + \u21e5(x, \u02c6p,t )]\n\u0000\n\u0000 1\n\u0000\u00001\n, (74)\nthus \u21e5(x, \u02c6p,t )i st h ef r a c t i o n a lt e m p e r a t u r ep e r t u r b a t i o nf o rp h o t o n sp r o p g a t i n gi nag i v e n\ndirection \u02c6p.T h e q u a n t i t y\u00b5 is the cosine of the angle between the wavevectork and the\nphoton propagation direction \u02c6p, R =3 \u21e2b/(4\u21e2r), and we have simpli\ufb01ed the equation by\nassuming that Thomson scattering is isotropic. The time derivatives here are with respect to\nthe conformal time de\ufb01ned byd\u2318 = dt/a(t). The quantities  and \u0000 are new, and result from\ntreating the situation in GR. Basically, two perturbations to the metric describe the e\u21b5ect\nof weak gravitational \ufb01elds resulting from the \ufb02uctuations for so-called scalar peturbations,\nwhere  corresponds to what we usually think of as the Newtonian gravitational potential,\nand \u0000 corresponds to a perturbation of the spatial curvature.\nIt is instructive to compare these equations to what we derived previously for Newtonian\nperturbation theory:\n@\u0000\n@t + 1\nar\u00b7 \u0000v =0 ( C o n t i n u i t y ) ( 7 5 )\n@\u0000v\n@t + H\u0000v = \u00001\nar\u0000\u0000 \u0000 c2\ns\na r\u0000 (Euler) (76)\nr2\u0000\u0000=4 \u21e1Ga2\u21e20\u0000 (Poisson). (77)\nAlthough the Boltzmann version looks complicated, every term has an immediately clear\nphysical interpretation. The left-hand side of the \ufb01rst equation for \u21e5 is a convective de-\nrivtative, representingphoton free streaming.W e c a n t h i n k o f t h i s a s t h e a n a l o g o f t h e\n20\ncontinuity equation for the photons, but with source terms on the right-hand side. The \ufb01rst\ntwo terms on the right-hand side are the time dilation and gravitational redshift e\u21b5ects that\ngive rise to the Sachs-Wolfe e\u21b5ect, and describe the change in the energy of the photons as\nthey propagate through a perturbed spactime. The last term on the right-hand side repre-\nsents the redistribution of photons by Thomson scattering, which brings in the optical depth,\n\u2327,a n di n c l u d e saD o p p l e rb o o s tf r o mt h ev e l o c i t yo ft h eb a r y o n\ufb02 u i d .T h es e c o n de q u a t i o n\nis the force equation for the baryon velocity, which we knew as the Euler equation in the\nNewtonian analysis. It has the same form, except that it includes a second terms on the\nright-hand side to represent momentum tranfer to the baryons from the scattered photons.\nThis is quite nasty, as it involves \u21e51,w h i c hi st h ed i p o l em o m e n to ft h et e m p e r a t u r e\ufb01 e l d\n\u21e5 \u2318 \u0000T/T .S ow eh a v e\n\u02d9\u21e5+ ik\u00b5\u21e5| {z }\nconvective derivative\n= \u0000 \u02d9\u0000 \u0000 ik\u00b5 | {z }\nSW e\u21b5ect\n\u0000 \u02d9\u2327 [\u00b5vb \u0000 \u21e5]| {z }\nThomson scattering\n\u02d9vb + \u02d9a\navb\n| {z }\naccel. & Hubble drag\n= \u0000ik | {z }\npotential gradient\n+ \u02d9\u2327\nR [vb +3 i\u21e51]\n| {z }\ngeneralized pressure\n.

The wavevectork sets\na natural polar axis, and the temperature anisotropy corresponds to knowing the photon\nphase-space distribution at our location in space, that is, the distribution of the photons in\nenergy and as a function of angle with respect tok.E v o l v i n g t h i s f u n c t i o n i s h a r d p r i n c i p a l l y\nbecause of the coupling between radiation and matter set by Thomson scattering.

In fact, it is\nclear that the force must be proportional to the dipole monent of the distribution function\nwhich is the origin of the \u21e51 in the equation above. This creates an obvious problem: it\ncouples the evolution of the number of photons traveling in a given direction\u02c6p with knowledge\nof the whole distribution. Mathematically, we have an integro-di\u21b5erential equation.\nIn practice, rather than trying to numerically solve for the photon distribution function\n(normally denoted by \u21e5), we can carry out a multipole transform to work with \u21e5`.T h e\nintegro-di\u21b5erential equation then becomes a set of equations that couple di\u21b5erent` values.\nThese have to be solved as a large set of equations (since the CMB power spectrum contains\nsignal extending beyond` & 1000), and when this is done we will have to integrate overk-\nspace. It took many years to solve this numerical challenge, and even then the computations\nwere very slow. A key development in cosmology was the development of CMBFAST in\n1996 by Seljak and Zaldarriaga, who \ufb01gured out a trick to perform the required Boltzmann\nequation integrations much faster than was previously possible. Their public release of this\ncode allowed computation of the CMB angular power spectrum su\u0000ciently rapidly that a\nlarge range of models could be investigated by non-specialists. We discussed these Boltzmann\nsolvers previously when we discussed transfer functions in linear structure formation. There\n21\nare now other codes that supercede CMBFAST in accuracy and ease of use like CMBEASY,\nCAMB, CLASS, and PyCosmo.\n22\n48 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN FEBRUARY 2004\nBRYAN CHRISTIE DESIGN\nCOSMIC HARMONICS\nTHE SOUND SPECTRUM of the early universe had overtones much\nlike a musical instrument\u2019s. If you blow into a pipe, the sound\ncorresponds to a wave with maximum air compression (blue) at\nthe mouthpiece and maximum rarefaction (red) at the end\npiece. But the sound also has a series of overtones with shorter\nwavelengths that are integer fractions of the fundamental\nwavelength. (The wavelengths of the first, second and third\novertones are one half, one third and one fourth as long.)\nSOUND WAVES also oscillated in the plasma of the early\nuniverse. After inflation, the fundamental wave compressed\nsome regions of plasma and rarefied others, causing the\ntemperature of the CMB radiation in the regions to reach\nmaximum (blue) and minimum (red) values by the time of\nrecombination. The overtones oscillated two, three or more\ntimes as quickly, causing smaller regions to reach maximum and\nminimum CMB temperatures at the time of recombination.\nHot region\nCold region\nMaximum compression Maximum rarefactionSOUND WAVES IN A PIPE\nACOUSTIC OSCILLATIONS\nIN THE EARLY UNIVERSE\nFigure 7: Analogy between standing waves in a pipe, and acoustic oscillations in the baryon-\nphoton plasma.
